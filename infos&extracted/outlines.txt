<FACE,20,2>Wanna find out how good you are? Sure thing!
<FACE,58,2>Can you appreciate the beauty of bird POKÈMON in flight?
<FACE,18,2>I'm FALKNER! I'm going to be the toughest bird master ever!
<FACE,39,2>Don't you dare make fun of bug POKÈMON.
<FACE,13,0>We're little, but we try hard!
<FACE,59,2>I'm the bug POKÈMON researcher, BUGSY! Ready to get started?
<FACE,38,2>Would you like to see my POKÈMON cuties?

<FACE,5,0>Greetings. How good of you to come. Shall we get started?
<FACE,22,0>Hi-yaaah! Do you believe in unseen powers?
<FACE,36,0>You can bear witness to the fruits of my training.
<FACE,28,2>Hi-yah! I'll battle you with powerful FIGHTING-type POKÈMON!
<FACE,54,2>I'm CHUCK! Come on! Hi-yah!
<FACE,37,1>Um, I'm JASMINE. Pleased to meet you.
<FACE,48,2>What are you doing here? There's something fishy about you...
<FACE,47,2>Don't you run from me! I'm taking you down, brat!
<FACE,45,1>So it's you! You're the little brat who's been wandering around
here.
<FACE,46,0>Oh? You've come all this way? Fine. I accept your challenge.
<FACE,3,1>The colder it gets, the tougher our POKÈMON get!
<FACE,55,2>Skiing has to be the ultimate winter sport.
<FACE,63,0>Youth alone does not ensure victory! Experience is what counts.
<FACE,9,2>I train by battling as many trainers as I can.
<FACE,10,2>Come face my thoroughly toughened POKÈMON!
<FACE,21,0>I am CLAIR, the dragon user. You're challenging me?
<FACE,23,0>So, you have finally reached me. All right. Prepare for battle!
<FACE,32,2>Ah, so it is you who defeated WILL? Interesting...
<FACE,53,1>I'm BRUNO. As one of the ELITE FOUR, I will stand up to your
challenge!
<FACE,29,0>I am KAREN. Would you care for a showdown with my DARK-type
POKÈMON?
<FACE,61,2>I've been waiting for you. Allow me to test your skill.
<FACE,35,2>Ten-hut! I'm SURGE! So you want to battle?
<FACE,40,2>I am SABRINA. I will foresee everything that you try to do.
<FACE,30,2>It's my turn! I'm MISTY, the water POKÈMON trainer!
<FACE,11,2>Ah... Are you my partner? I hope that's okay with you.
<FACE,1,2>Yep, I'm JANINE. You're saying you beat my father?
<FACE,56,2>So you finally made it this far. I'm BROCK. Bring it on!
<FACE,31,2>I'm BLAINE, the fire expert! Let's get cookin'!

<FACE,26,1>Summer means the beach, and POKÈMON means battle! Let's do it!
<FACE,62,0>She'll be comin' round the mountain... Huh? Battle?
<FACE,50,2>...mutter...POKÈMON and...entropy... Huh? Don't disturb me!
<FACE,41,1>I'll make your POKÈMON infatuated.
<FACE,27,0>You wanna know who I am? You honestly think I could, like,
tell you?
<FACE,3,1>All right! I'm gonna freeze your POKÈMON solid, man!
<FACE,44,0>I perceived a jolt. You possess inordinate power.
<FACE,7,0>There is no possibility of my POKÈMON losing.
<FACE,57,2>You're weird. I look pretty tough, don't I?
<FACE,19,0>To earn recognition as a FIREBREATHER, you have to be familiar
with fire!
<FACE,4,2>Yo! Do you realize who you're challenging?
<FACE,52,0>Who are you to challenge a teacher?
<FACE,8,2>How would you like to battle a joker like me? I guarantee you'll be
surprised!
<FACE,5,0>To be able to dedicate myself to training--should I be grateful
for that?
<FACE,34,1>Hi. You into POKÈMON, too? Then you've gotta battle me!

<FACE,34,1>Hi. You into POKÈMON, too? Then you've gotta battle me!
<FACE,6,1>I'll show you the power of the great outdoors. It's truly wild!
<FACE,22,2>Hee, hee, hee...
<FACE,48,2>Huh? You're challenging me? Are you serious?
<FACE,42,2>I think you would make a good practice partner.
<FACE,16,2>I let my guitar do the talkin'! I'll rock 'n' roll right over you!
<FACE,12,2>We men of the sea are proud of our muscles! I'm also proud of my
POKÈMON!
<FACE,47,2>Sorry, kid, but I'm going to use you for practice.
<FACE,24,1>Working on my juggling and polishing my battle skills--they're
similar in a way.
<FACE,13,0>We're JAN and JANE. We work hard together.
<FACE,60,2>Some fishermen have no patience at all! Hurry up, already!
<FACE,25,2>I always get perfect scores on tests! You don't stand a chance!
<FACE,2,2>I'm going to challenge your POKÈMON. It's obvious you're proud
of them.
<FACE,43,0>Even we officers can participate. After all, I'm on my break.
<FACE,33,1>A battle? That sounds rather frightening.
<FACE,17,2>It's time to test my research results! Sorry, but you will be my
test subject.
<FACE,14,0>POKÈMON are popular in my country. How are they perceived here?
<FACE,6,1>I'll show you the power of the great outdoors. It's truly wild!

<FACE,57,2>In this tournament, you can't win unless you're really good.
<FACE,42,2>Battle? Okay, but just for a little while.
<FACE,6,1>I'll take you on with my patented strategy!
<FACE,7,0>My POKÈMON are very smart.
<FACE,25,2>I see all sorts of POKÈMON in the grass on the way home from my
tutor's.
<FACE,2,2>I hear the sea calling me... Of course, in the winter, it's just the
pool.
<FACE,52,0>Oh, hello. What kinds of POKÈMON do you like?
<FACE,8,2>When it comes to POKÈMON, I can't lose!
<FACE,38,2>A battle? Certainly!
<FACE,28,2>Hi-yah! I've dedicated my life to fighting POKÈMON!
<FACE,58,2>Bird POKÈMON are found in the skies all around the world.
<FACE,9,2>I study extensively. That makes me strong.
<FACE,60,2>Which is the key in fishing, equipment or skill? The answer is both!
<FACE,17,2>POKÈMON research is very extensive.
<FACE,55,2>Do you play any winter sports?
<FACE,10,2>I will be your last opponent! Let's do it!
<FACE,58,2>Can you appreciate the beauty of bird POKÈMON in flight?

<FACE,6,1>Do you know the weaknesses of GRASS-type POKÈMON?
<FACE,50,1>The weaknesses of FIRE-type POKÈMON? ...I can't tell you that.
<FACE,25,2>A battle is waged with three POKÈMON per side.
<FACE,26,0>Initiate <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ACID ARMOR<COL1,POP> & <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BARRIER<COL1,POP> plan!...Come on, let's boogie!
<FACE,57,2>Bang, bang, bang! Try a blast of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP>!
<FACE,42,2>Aren't my POKÈMON nice? But they're very...uh...forgetful.
<FACE,38,2><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SWIFT<COL1,POP> is about the only attack that will hit!
<FACE,34,0>All of my POKÈMON are girls! So lovely!
<FACE,33,1>I'll start with <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MURKROW<COL1,POP>.
<FACE,38,1>I have DUAL-type POKÈMON. Will you be able to exploit the
weaknesses of both types?
<FACE,57,1>We're gonna do it with <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>!
<FACE,25,1>Our special defense is secure! <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>LIGHT SCREEN<COL1,POP>, we've got it!
<FACE,10,2><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>'s power is outrageous.
Which POKÈMON wants to take it?
<FACE,9,2>Oh my... Will those POKÈMON be able to keep up with our speed?
<FACE,24,0>Let me see your combos!
<FACE,2,2>I wonder if you could beat me.

<FACE,20,2>Boy, are you impatient! All right, here I come!
<FACE,58,2>Have you ever dreamed of flying?
<FACE,18,2>I can't let you get past me. The honor of bird trainers
everywhere is at stake! 
<FACE,39,2>Heh, heh. You might want to rethink your opinion of these guys.
<FACE,13,0>We've even beaten grownups before!
<FACE,59,2>You probably don't know very much about bug POKÈMON.
<FACE,38,2>Oh, your POKÈMON are adorable, too.
<FACE,41,1>Oh, aren't you cute! A battle? Certainly.
<FACE,0,1>Hey! Don't you think POKÈMON are, like, super cute?
<FACE,5,0>First, calm your emotions and concentrate.
<FACE,22,1>Hmm... I can see your future!
<FACE,36,0>Whether you choose to believe or not, mystic power does exist.
<FACE,28,2>Hi-yah! I hate picky little things! Come on!
<FACE,54,2>Hah! You want to challenge me? Are you brave or just ignorant?
<FACE,37,1>Oh... Your POKÈMON are impressive. I think I will enjoy this.
<FACE,48,2>What? Battle? Challenging TEAM ROCKET? ...Oh, all right.
<FACE,47,2>What was he doing!?! How'd he lose to a brat like you?
<FACE,45,1>Hmph! Your sharp gaze makes you seem at least a little
competent. 
<FACE,46,0>I have received reports that your skills are not insignificant.
<FACE,3,1>Chill out! I'll keep you frozen 'til spring!
<FACE,55,2>Lots of trainers take their POKÈMON to the ski slopes.
<FACE,63,0>Fine. I will help you improve.
<FACE,9,2>I'm in heavy training with my sights on the summit! Would you
spar with me?
<FACE,10,2>I can see that you're a skilled trainer. Let's give it a go!
<FACE,21,0>So, you're aiming for the top? Well, we'll just see about that.
<FACE,23,0>Have you studied up on PSYCHIC-type POKÈMON?
<FACE,32,2>Your arrival is indeed impressive, as is your look of resolve.
<FACE,53,1>You appear to be quite skilled, but this is your last stop!
<FACE,29,0>You've assembled a charming team. Our battle should be a
good one.
<FACE,61,2>I am still the CHAMPION. I won't hold anything back.
<FACE,35,2>Electric POKÈMON are the best! Do you still want to try me?
<FACE,40,2>Psychics aren't flashy, but they are terrifying, nonetheless.
<FACE,30,2>It sounds like you're pretty good, but I won't lose!
<FACE,11,2>...Oh? I beg your pardon. I seem to have dozed off...
<FACE,1,2>My POKÈMON are masters of poisonous moves.
<FACE,56,2>Have you ever seen the durability of rock POKÈMON? Here goes!
<FACE,31,2>Men who have burning ambition use fire POKÈMON! Say your
prayers!
<FACE,15,2>I don't know about your strategy, but balance is the key!
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,51,1>You just get on my nerves! I'll whip you right now!
<FACE,39,2>Can you effectively control bug POKÈMON?
<FACE,26,1>When I watch the sea, my troubles get washed away. A battle?
Okay!
<FACE,62,0>The mountains are the greatest! It's inspiring to see a sunrise
from the summit!
<FACE,50,2>Any battle can be won by applying logic. What? You want to test
my hypothesis?
<FACE,41,1>I'll show you how grownups battle.
<FACE,27,0>I'm busy. Can we get started, like, in a hurry?
<FACE,3,1>Lemme tell ya--our hearts burn hot!
<FACE,44,0>Let me look into your soul... What! Defeat me?
<FACE,7,0>Would you be so kind as to show me your POKÈMON?
<FACE,57,2>Are you sure you want to battle? I'm number one at my school.
<FACE,19,0>Firebreathing was tough to learn. Check it out!
<FACE,4,2>I've raised my group really well. I'll teach you a lesson!
<FACE,52,0>All of the students in my class are crazy about POKÈMON.
<FACE,8,2>My POKÈMON are the best in the world! I'm not blinded by love,
either!
<FACE,5,0>The struggle to achieve inner peace is another battle.
<FACE,34,1>Among POKÈMANIACs, ----- is hip. You can fill in the blanks.
<FACE,39,2>Can you effectively control bug POKÈMON?

<FACE,27,0>I'm busy. Can we get started, like, in a hurry?
<FACE,3,1>Lemme tell ya--our hearts burn hot!
<FACE,44,0>Let me look into your soul... What! Defeat me?
<FACE,7,0>Would you be so kind as to show me your POKÈMON?
<FACE,57,2>Are you sure you want to battle? I'm number one at my school.
<FACE,19,0>Firebreathing was tough to learn. Check it out!
<FACE,4,2>I've raised my group really well. I'll teach you a lesson!
<FACE,52,0>All of the students in my class are crazy about POKÈMON.
<FACE,8,2>My POKÈMON are the best in the world! I'm not blinded by love,
either!
<FACE,5,0>The struggle to achieve inner peace is another battle.
<FACE,34,1>Among POKÈMANIACs, ----- is hip. You can fill in the blanks.
<FACE,6,1>I practice even when I'm camping. I can't lose!
<FACE,22,2>You... Have you no fear?
<FACE,48,2>I won't care if anything happens to your POKÈMON.
<FACE,42,2>I train even when I go on picnics.
<FACE,16,2>Overdrive riff! Rock is a full-body experience.
<FACE,12,2>When we're out at sea, POKÈMON battles are our favorite
entertainment. Come on!
<FACE,47,2>What's with you? Doesn't TEAM ROCKET terrify you?
<FACE,24,1>Do you know the FIREBREATHER? We're kindred spirits.
<FACE,13,0>Treating us like babies is a big no-no!
<FACE,60,2>When I have a line in the water, I don't just stand there doing
nothing.
<FACE,25,2>I'm the best at school and in all my clubs. Do you still want to
battle?
<FACE,2,2>You don't think I'm up to this, do you? You're going to regret
that.
<FACE,43,0>Battles are perfectly legal, but POKÈMON abuse is not.
<FACE,33,1>Aren't my POKÈMON attractive? Would you care to see them
perform?
<FACE,17,2>I was cooped up in the lab. I needed a break, so here I am.
<FACE,14,0>On my travels, I often practice against SAILORs.
<FACE,6,1>I practice even when I'm camping. I can't lose!

<FACE,14,0>On my travels, I often practice against SAILORs.
<FACE,57,2>Hey! What's with that look of scorn?
<FACE,42,2>A battle? Certainly.
<FACE,6,1>I won't be responsible for what happens to your POKÈMON.
<FACE,7,0>Whatever the attack, it doesn't hurt if it doesn't hit.
<FACE,25,2>Oh, you have some good POKÈMON with you. Let's battle.
<FACE,2,2>Wait 'til you see my strategy. You're in for a big surprise!
<FACE,52,0>I would like to evaluate your skill level. But don't worry. This
isn't a test.
<FACE,8,2>What do you think? Do you want to have a quick battle?
<FACE,38,2>I absolutely will not lose to you!
<FACE,28,2>Hi-yah! Come at me as hard as you can!
<FACE,58,2>Have you caught any bird POKÈMON?
<FACE,9,2>I'm not going to pull any punches! Ready?
<FACE,60,2>Assessing the situation and the opponent... Fishing is like
battling.
<FACE,17,2>I began a new research project. Let me show you.
<FACE,55,2>Hi! I'm KATHY. Pleased to meet you.
<FACE,10,2>You seem quite skilled. I'm looking forward to this.
<FACE,58,2>Have you ever dreamed of flying?
<FACE,18,2>I can't let you get past me. The honor of bird trainers
everywhere is at stake! 
<FACE,39,2>Heh, heh. You might want to rethink your opinion of these guys.
<FACE,13,0>We've even beaten grownups before!
<FACE,59,2>You probably don't know very much about bug POKÈMON.
<FACE,38,2>Oh, your POKÈMON are adorable, too.
<FACE,41,1>Oh, aren't you cute! A battle? Certainly.
<FACE,0,1>Hey! Don't you think POKÈMON are, like, super cute?
<FACE,5,0>First, calm your emotions and concentrate.
<FACE,22,1>Hmm... I can see your future!
<FACE,36,0>Whether you choose to believe or not, mystic power does exist.
<FACE,28,2>Hi-yah! I hate picky little things! Come on!
<FACE,54,2>Hah! You want to challenge me? Are you brave or just ignorant?
<FACE,37,1>Oh... Your POKÈMON are impressive. I think I will enjoy this.
<FACE,48,2>What? Battle? Challenging TEAM ROCKET? ...Oh, all right.
<FACE,47,2>What was he doing!?! How'd he lose to a brat like you?
<FACE,45,1>Hmph! Your sharp gaze makes you seem at least a little
competent. 
<FACE,46,0>I have received reports that your skills are not insignificant.
<FACE,3,1>Chill out! I'll keep you frozen 'til spring!
<FACE,55,2>Lots of trainers take their POKÈMON to the ski slopes.
<FACE,63,0>Fine. I will help you improve.
<FACE,9,2>I'm in heavy training with my sights on the summit! Would you
spar with me?
<FACE,10,2>I can see that you're a skilled trainer. Let's give it a go!
<FACE,21,0>So, you're aiming for the top? Well, we'll just see about that.
<FACE,23,0>Have you studied up on PSYCHIC-type POKÈMON?
<FACE,32,2>Your arrival is indeed impressive, as is your look of resolve.
<FACE,53,1>You appear to be quite skilled, but this is your last stop!
<FACE,29,0>You've assembled a charming team. Our battle should be a
good one.
<FACE,61,2>I am still the CHAMPION. I won't hold anything back.
<FACE,35,2>Electric POKÈMON are the best! Do you still want to try me?
<FACE,40,2>Psychics aren't flashy, but they are terrifying, nonetheless.
<FACE,30,2>It sounds like you're pretty good, but I won't lose!
<FACE,11,2>...Oh? I beg your pardon. I seem to have dozed off...
<FACE,1,2>My POKÈMON are masters of poisonous moves.
<FACE,56,2>Have you ever seen the durability of rock POKÈMON? Here goes!
<FACE,31,2>Men who have burning ambition use fire POKÈMON! Say your
prayers!
<FACE,15,2>I don't know about your strategy, but balance is the key!
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,39,2>Can you effectively control bug POKÈMON?
<FACE,26,1>When I watch the sea, my troubles get washed away. A battle?
Okay!
<FACE,62,0>The mountains are the greatest! It's inspiring to see a sunrise
from the summit!
<FACE,50,2>Any battle can be won by applying logic. What? You want to test
my hypothesis?
<FACE,41,1>I'll show you how grownups battle.
<FACE,27,0>I'm busy. Can we get started, like, in a hurry?
<FACE,3,1>Lemme tell ya--our hearts burn hot!
<FACE,44,0>Let me look into your soul... What! Defeat me?
<FACE,7,0>Would you be so kind as to show me your POKÈMON?
<FACE,57,2>Are you sure you want to battle? I'm number one at my school.
<FACE,19,0>Firebreathing was tough to learn. Check it out!

<FACE,51,1>You just get on my nerves! I'll whip you right now!
<FACE,6,1>Do you know the weaknesses of GRASS-type POKÈMON?
<FACE,50,1>Effective moves against FIRE-type POKÈMON? ...I can't tell you
that.
<FACE,25,2>A move won't work unless it exploits a weakness. ...Do you want to
try me?
<FACE,26,1>Initiate <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ACID ARMOR<COL1,POP> & <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BARRIER<COL1,POP> plan! Ready or not, here I come!
<FACE,57,2>Let's see you dodge this one!
<FACE,42,2>Have you ever experienced the power of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP>?
<FACE,38,2>Could you even hit me?
<FACE,34,0>Did you know that there are conditions that are similar to status
problems?
<FACE,33,1>My starting POKÈMON will be <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MURKROW<COL1,POP>.
<FACE,38,1>Will you be able to take advantage of both weaknesses that some
POKÈMON have?
<FACE,57,1>Contact! We're gonna <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP>!
<FACE,25,1>Our special defense is secure!
<FACE,10,2><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP> can KO most POKÈMON with one shot.
<FACE,9,2>Your POKÈMON look rather languid. Can they keep up with our
speed?
<FACE,24,0>I'd like to see some elegant combos. My DRAGONITE and
TYRANITAR will take you on.
<FACE,2,2>I've taught my POKÈMON <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MINIMIZE<COL1,POP>. Heh, heh. We're perfect!

<FACE,20,2>Hey! Let's battle!
<FACE,58,2>Nothing in the world can match the beauty of bird POKÈMON.
<FACE,18,2>Sorry, but there's no way I'll lose to your POKÈMON!
<FACE,39,2>I'll bet you don't know how great bug POKÈMON are.
<FACE,13,0>You'll be surprised at how strong we are!
<FACE,59,2>Ready? I'll show you just how tough bug POKÈMON can be!
<FACE,38,2>Did you beat BUGSY? I don't really like bug POKÈMON.
<FACE,41,1>Hi, you cute little trainer. How about a battle?
<FACE,0,1>I'm ready whenever you are. You look pretty tough yourself.
<FACE,5,0>I consider this battle to be part of my training.
<FACE,22,2>Hmm... I sense something in you...
<FACE,36,0>You must make your soul one with that of POKÈMON. Can you
do this?
<FACE,28,2>Hi-yah! My fists are harder than stone! Do you want to try me?
<FACE,54,2>You didn't falter at the sight of us. You must have guts. Come on!
<FACE,37,1>You must be quite strong to make it this far.
<FACE,48,2>Do you know where you are?
<FACE,47,2>Are you listening? I'm going to rub you out and become an
EXECUTIVE.
<FACE,45,1>Your trip ends here. I'm going to take you down!
<FACE,46,0>I'm sorry to say it, but this is the end. I will eliminate you.
<FACE,3,1>Even in a blizzard, we're still blazing hot!
<FACE,55,2>You don't even notice the cold when you're having fun. Isn't
that strange?
<FACE,63,0>The rigors of youth are certain to improve your character.
<FACE,9,2>I'm hoping to discover something through my battles.
<FACE,10,2>Go a round with me before you shoot for the top!
<FACE,21,0>Do you know who I am? And you still dare to challenge me?
<FACE,23,0>I have observed your battle techniques. I'm ready for you!
<FACE,32,2>Would you care for a glimpse into the world of the ninja?
<FACE,53,1>It would disturb me for you to underestimate my fighting
POKÈMON. Get ready!
<FACE,29,0>I am unlike the three you've already met.
<FACE,61,2>I thought that you would be able to get this far. Let's get this
started.
<FACE,35,2>Okay! So you want to be electrified?
<FACE,40,2>The unseen power that is psychic force... Let us begin.
<FACE,30,2>So you're here! My water POKÈMON are ready for you!
<FACE,11,2>Seeing flowers in a garden is so soothing.
<FACE,1,2>I know you're tough. This is deadly serious!
<FACE,56,2>When it comes to rock POKÈMON, I'm the best! Come on!
<FACE,31,2>My next opponent? It's none other than you!
<FACE,15,2>You must be pretty good to get this far.
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,51,1>There's room for only one CHAMP! I'll make you understand that!
<FACE,39,2>I raised my bug POKÈMON carefully. They'll take you on!
<FACE,26,1>Aren't the ladies here lovely? Oh, you want to battle?
<FACE,62,0>When I'm up in the mountains, the annoying things in life become
insignificant.
<FACE,50,2>Huh? Battle? I don't want to. Can't I just refuse?
<FACE,41,1>You learn from experience. Let's battle!
<FACE,27,0>A battle? Like, sure! I'm like working, but...
<FACE,3,1>You know, you can't move if you're frozen.
<FACE,44,0>...I see... Fine. Let's get started.
<FACE,7,0>My POKÈMON are so much stronger and cuter than your POKÈMON!
<FACE,57,2>There are no more opponents in my neighborhood.
<FACE,19,0>You'll come to fear the power of red-hot flames!
<FACE,4,2>Heh, you're not allowed to pass without showing us some respect.
<FACE,52,0>I know it's not a grown-up thing to do, but I don't want to
lose either!
<FACE,8,2>I can't embarrass my club. I can't afford to lose.
<FACE,5,0>One must not try to flee from misery.
<FACE,34,1>You want to see my POKÈMON? Oh, okay. Sure.
<FACE,39,2>I raised my bug POKÈMON carefully. They'll take you on!
<FACE,26,1>Aren't the ladies here lovely? Oh, you want to battle?

<FACE,5,0>One must not try to flee from misery.
<FACE,34,1>You want to see my POKÈMON? Oh, okay. Sure.
<FACE,6,1>The POKÈMON I caught in the mountains and forests are tough!
<FACE,22,2>Nnnnnn... Keeeh!
<FACE,48,2>Ha, ha, ha... I'll bring you down slowly but surely.
<FACE,42,2>It feels wonderful to battle POKÈMON outside!
<FACE,16,2>Guitars are my life! But unplugged is wimpy!
<FACE,12,2>I often battle passengers from other countries. I do all the
winning, though.
<FACE,47,2>Are you ready to lose?
<FACE,24,1>These balls contain VOLTORB. Juggling them is such a rush.
<FACE,13,0>We're serious about battling. You'd better get ready.
<FACE,60,2>Have you ever gone fishing? Isn't it addictive?
<FACE,25,2>Which POKÈMON is the most popular at your school?
<FACE,2,2>I'm going to finish this quickly, then go for a swim!
<FACE,43,0>The streets have been quiet, so I've had time to thoroughly train
my squad.
<FACE,33,1>I can't beat my mother or the senior girls in our troupe.
<FACE,17,2>You study POKÈMON, too? Let's compare our abilities!
<FACE,14,0>Ah, you look determined. Would you care to join me in a battle?
<FACE,6,1>The POKÈMON I caught in the mountains and forests are tough!
<FACE,22,2>Nnnnnn... Keeeh!

<FACE,57,2>Okay then! I'll settle this in a cool way!
<FACE,42,2>Let's keep our battle clean and refreshing.
<FACE,6,1>I may not look like much, but I do have self-confidence.
<FACE,7,0>Come on, everyone. It's time for you to make an appearance.
<FACE,25,2>I was just looking for an opponent.
<FACE,2,2>Let's get started, shall we?
<FACE,52,0>We should both work our hardest so there won't be any regrets
afterwards.
<FACE,8,2>These babies are tough. Oh, you don't believe me?
<FACE,38,2>I know. You want to battle.
But I, TERRY, have confidence in myself.
<FACE,28,2>Hi-yah! I'll drop you before you can say, "Boo!"
<FACE,58,2>Taking proper care of bird POKÈMON is rewarding.
<FACE,9,2>Let's have a battle for practice's sake.
<FACE,60,2>Different kinds of fishermen go after different kinds of fish.
<FACE,17,2>I haven't battled in a while. I wonder how I will fare.
<FACE,55,2>You'll freeze if you're not careful.
<FACE,10,2>I hate to say this, but I can't afford to lose to you.
<FACE,58,2>Nothing in the world can match the beauty of bird POKÈMON.
<FACE,18,2>Sorry, but there's no way I'll lose to your POKÈMON!
<FACE,39,2>I'll bet you don't know how great bug POKÈMON are.
<FACE,13,0>You'll be surprised at how strong we are!
<FACE,59,2>Ready? I'll show you just how tough bug POKÈMON can be!
<FACE,38,2>Did you beat BUGSY? I don't really like bug POKÈMON.
<FACE,41,1>Hi, you cute little trainer. How about a battle?

<FACE,36,0>You must make your soul one with that of POKÈMON. Can you
do this?
<FACE,28,2>Hi-yah! My fists are harder than stone! Do you want to try me?
<FACE,54,2>You didn't falter at the sight of us. You must have guts. Come on!
<FACE,37,1>You must be quite strong to make it this far.
<FACE,48,2>Do you know where you are?
<FACE,47,2>Are you listening? I'm going to rub you out and become an
EXECUTIVE.
<FACE,45,1>Your trip ends here. I'm going to take you down!
<FACE,46,0>I'm sorry to say it, but this is the end. I will eliminate you.
<FACE,3,1>Even in a blizzard, we're still blazing hot!
<FACE,55,2>You don't even notice the cold when you're having fun. Isn't
that strange?
<FACE,63,0>The rigors of youth are certain to improve your character.
<FACE,9,2>I'm hoping to discover something through my battles.
<FACE,10,2>Go a round with me before you shoot for the top!
<FACE,21,0>Do you know who I am? And you still dare to challenge me?
<FACE,23,0>I have observed your battle techniques. I'm ready for you!
<FACE,32,2>Would you care for a glimpse into the world of the ninja?
<FACE,53,1>It would disturb me for you to underestimate my fighting
POKÈMON. Get ready!
<FACE,29,0>I am unlike the three you've already met.
<FACE,61,2>I thought that you would be able to get this far. Let's get this
started.
<FACE,35,2>Okay! So you want to be electrified?
<FACE,40,2>The unseen power that is psychic force... Let us begin.
<FACE,30,2>So you're here! My water POKÈMON are ready for you!
<FACE,11,2>Seeing flowers in a garden is so soothing.
<FACE,1,2>I know you're tough. This is deadly serious!
<FACE,56,2>When it comes to rock POKÈMON, I'm the best! Come on!
<FACE,31,2>My next opponent? It's none other than you!
<FACE,15,2>You must be pretty good to get this far.
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,39,2>I raised my bug POKÈMON carefully. They'll take you on!
<FACE,26,1>Aren't the ladies here lovely? Oh, you want to battle?
<FACE,62,0>When I'm up in the mountains, the annoying things in life become
insignificant.
<FACE,50,2>Huh? Battle? I don't want to. Can't I just refuse?
<FACE,41,1>You learn from experience. Let's battle!
<FACE,27,0>A battle? Like, sure! I'm like working, but...
<FACE,3,1>You know, you can't move if you're frozen.
<FACE,44,0>...I see... Fine. Let's get started.
<FACE,7,0>My POKÈMON are so much stronger and cuter than your POKÈMON!
<FACE,57,2>There are no more opponents in my neighborhood.
<FACE,19,0>You'll come to fear the power of red-hot flames!
<FACE,4,2>Heh, you're not allowed to pass without showing us some respect.
<FACE,52,0>I know it's not a grown-up thing to do, but I don't want to
lose either!
<FACE,8,2>I can't embarrass my club. I can't afford to lose.
<FACE,5,0>One must not try to flee from misery.
<FACE,34,1>You want to see my POKÈMON? Oh, okay. Sure.
<FACE,39,2>I raised my bug POKÈMON carefully. They'll take you on!
<FACE,26,1>Aren't the ladies here lovely? Oh, you want to battle?
<FACE,62,0>When I'm up in the mountains, the annoying things in life become
insignificant.
<FACE,50,2>Huh? Battle? I don't want to. Can't I just refuse?
<FACE,41,1>You learn from experience. Let's battle!
<FACE,27,0>A battle? Like, sure! I'm like working, but...
<FACE,3,1>You know, you can't move if you're frozen.
<FACE,44,0>...I see... Fine. Let's get started.
<FACE,7,0>My POKÈMON are so much stronger and cuter than your POKÈMON!
<FACE,57,2>There are no more opponents in my neighborhood.
<FACE,19,0>You'll come to fear the power of red-hot flames!
<FACE,4,2>Heh, you're not allowed to pass without showing us some respect.

<FACE,8,2>I can't embarrass my club. I can't afford to lose.
<FACE,5,0>One must not try to flee from misery.
<FACE,34,1>You want to see my POKÈMON? Oh, okay. Sure.
<FACE,6,1>The POKÈMON I caught in the mountains and forests are tough!
<FACE,22,2>Nnnnnn... Keeeh!
<FACE,46,0>What would you like to do? Turning back is a viable option.
<FACE,42,2>It feels wonderful to battle POKÈMON outside!
<FACE,16,2>Guitars are my life! But unplugged is wimpy!
<FACE,12,2>I often battle passengers from other countries. I do all the
winning, though.
<FACE,45,0>Ahahahaha... You? Defeat me? Ahahaha...That's so laughable!
<FACE,24,1>These balls contain VOLTORB. Juggling them is such a rush.
<FACE,13,0>We're serious about battling. You'd better get ready.
<FACE,60,2>Have you ever gone fishing? Isn't it addictive?
<FACE,25,2>Which POKÈMON is the most popular at your school?
<FACE,2,2>I'm going to finish this quickly, then go for a swim!
<FACE,43,0>The streets have been quiet, so I've had time to thoroughly train
my squad.
<FACE,33,1>I can't beat my mother or the senior girls in our troupe.
<FACE,17,2>You study POKÈMON, too? Let's compare our abilities!
<FACE,14,0>Ah, you look determined. Would you care to join me in a battle?
<FACE,6,1>The POKÈMON I caught in the mountains and forests are tough!
<FACE,22,2>Nnnnnn... Keeeh!
<FACE,46,0>What would you like to do? Turning back is a viable option.

<FACE,14,0>Ah, you look determined. Would you care to join me in a battle?
<FACE,57,2>Okay then! I'll settle this in a cool way!
<FACE,42,2>Let's keep our battle clean and refreshing.
<FACE,6,1>I may not look like much, but I do have self-confidence.
<FACE,7,0>Come on, everyone. It's time for you to make an appearance.
<FACE,25,2>I was just looking for an opponent.
<FACE,2,2>Let's get started, shall we?
<FACE,52,0>We should both work our hardest so there won't be any regrets
afterwards.
<FACE,8,2>These babies are tough. Oh, you don't believe me?
<FACE,38,2>I know. You want to battle.
But I, TERRY, have confidence in myself.
<FACE,28,2>Hi-yah! I'll drop you before you can say, "Boo!"
<FACE,58,2>Taking proper care of bird POKÈMON is rewarding.
<FACE,9,2>Let's have a battle for practice's sake.
<FACE,60,2>Different kinds of fishermen go after different kinds of fish.
<FACE,17,2>I haven't battled in a while. I wonder how I will fare.
<FACE,55,2>You'll freeze if you're not careful.
<FACE,10,2>I hate to say this, but I can't afford to lose to you.
<FACE,51,1>There's room for only one CHAMP! I'll make you understand that!
<FACE,6,1>I'll teach you the strengths of the grass type!
<FACE,50,1>I'll use you for experimentation.
<FACE,25,2>I'll negate any attack that doesn't exploit a weakness!
<FACE,26,0>Ah, soak it up! Initiate <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ACID ARMOR<COL1,POP> & <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>BARRIER<COL1,POP> plan!
<FACE,57,2>Can you dodge my <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP>?
<FACE,42,2>Do you find my POKÈMON nice? They're very forgetful.
<FACE,38,2>Quicker than the eye! Here comes my feared <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP>!
<FACE,34,0>I made a team of only female POKÈMON!
<FACE,33,1>My first POKÈMON will be <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MURKROW<COL1,POP>.
<FACE,38,1>Here we go, <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GYARADOS<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAGCARGO<COL1,POP>!
<FACE,57,1><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP> are gonna knock you outta your socks!
<FACE,25,1>Oh? Coming at me with PSYCHIC-type POKÈMON? I've prepared
for that!
<FACE,10,2>Have a blast of <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>. It's a one-hit KO for most POKÈMON.
<FACE,9,2>My POKÈMON are wickedly fast!
<FACE,24,0>Come try your combos on me.
<FACE,2,2>Do you like rainy days?

<FACE,39,2>You don't think bug POKÈMON are gross,
do you?
<FACE,13,0><WAZA,230,2>We'll make it smell nice.
<FACE,59,2>I love bug POKÈMON.
<FACE,38,2>Cute POKÈMON are absolutely the best. Don't

<FACE,28,0><WAZA,32,1>Come on, hit!
<FACE,54,2><DOKU,2>That should work well.
<FACE,37,0><MAHI,2>Oh, it's become paralyzed.
<FACE,48,1><MAHI,2>There. You be quiet now.
<FACE,47,2>You should join TEAM ROCKET, too.
<FACE,45,0><WAZA,218,2>Its FRUSTRATION is downright terrifying.
<FACE,46,0><DOKU,2>Ah... My condolences...
<FACE,3,1>Hey, you do any boarding yourself?
<FACE,55,2><HIRUMI,2>Oh, I'm sorry.
<FACE,63,0><KOHRI,2>Your roster took a hit.
<FACE,9,1><DOKU,2>Isn't that gooey feeling horrible?
<FACE,10,1><MEROMERO,2>Quite elegant, wouldn't you say?
<FACE,21,0>Could there be a stronger type than the
dragon type?
<FACE,23,0><MAHI,2>You really are unlucky.
<FACE,32,2>Even you must fear the dark.
<FACE,53,1><KONRAN,2>Right! What an opportunity!
<FACE,29,0>Wouldn't you agree that DARK-type POKÈMON
have their charms?
<FACE,61,1><MAHI,2>Yes! We own this match now!
<FACE,35,2>Do you enjoy battling?
<FACE,40,2>...
<FACE,30,1><AME,4>Okay! Watch me!
<FACE,11,1><NEMURI,4>Has it really drifted off to sleep?
<FACE,1,1><DOKUDOKU,2>Poisonous moves sap you steadily.
<FACE,56,1>It's been a while since I had a battle like this.
<FACE,31,0><WAZA,126,4>Duck and cover! FIRE BLAST!
<FACE,15,2>It's really something that you made it this
far.
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,51,0>What are you thinking?
<FACE,39,1><KONRAN,2>Yes, yes, yes!
<FACE,26,0>I'd love to go to a tropical beach!
<FACE,62,0>We HIKERs are well mannered!
<FACE,50,2><MAHI,4>You probably think I am an unpleasant
person.
<FACE,41,1><YADORIGI,2>Oh, look. The SEED took.
<FACE,27,0>The police are here somewhere, aren't they?
<FACE,3,1><WAZA,196,2>Gonna make you shiver like a wind chill!

<FACE,34,1><WAZA,95,4>Take that! Go to sleep!
<FACE,39,1><MAHI,2>It's confusing.
<FACE,26,0>I'd love to go to a tropical beach!

DRAGONBREATH!
<FACE,4,2><WAZA,57,4>What? Was it wrong to use SURF?
<FACE,52,0><WAZA,097,4>Agility is very important.
<FACE,8,2><WAZA,36,4>Go ahead, #26. TAKE DOWN.
<FACE,5,0><KONRAN,4>Ah, it was drawn into darkness.
<FACE,34,1><WAZA,225,4>Dragon power! DRAGONBREATH!
<FACE,6,1>The beach is nice, but the mountains are the

<FACE,22,1>Struggle though you may, it brings but
misery.
<FACE,48,2>Tenacious, aren't you?
<FACE,42,2>We run around outside with our POKÈMON.
<FACE,16,2>You betcha my hair's dyed!
<FACE,12,2><KOHRI,4>It's not going to move while it's frozen.

<FACE,25,1>Actually, I think even my teacher likes
POKÈMON.
<FACE,2,2>A sandy beach at night is wonderful.
<FACE,43,0>On my off-duty days, I groom my POKÈMON.
<FACE,33,1>We play with our POKÈMON every day.

<FACE,58,1>Fantastic! Bird POKÈMON are the greatest!
<FACE,18,2>Whew! That was a good battle.
<FACE,39,1>I did it! See? Didn't I tell you they were tough?
<FACE,13,0>Oh, wow! We won!
<FACE,59,2>See? Aren't bug POKÈMON tough?
<FACE,38,2>My darling POKÈMON are more than just cute.
<FACE,41,1>Oh! Oh, my! I won! Sorry, sweetie.
<FACE,0,1>What's wrong? I mean, your POKÈMON are good...
<FACE,5,0>I am grateful for this.
<FACE,22,0>You haven't learned to focus your mind!
<FACE,36,0>How unfortunate. But it's not enough.
<FACE,28,0>Yes, sir! That's the reward for my dedication to training!
<FACE,54,2>There. Do you realize how much more powerful I am than you?
<FACE,37,0>Thank you so much.
<FACE,48,2>Now get lost!
<FACE,47,1>Yes! I'm that much closer to becoming an EXECUTIVE!
<FACE,45,1>That was a wasted battle.
<FACE,46,0>What do you think? International-level POKÈMON are marvelous,
aren't they?
<FACE,3,0>All right then. Time for another run!
<FACE,55,1>Yahoo! Hey, this might be more fun than skiing.
<FACE,63,0>You have raw potential, but you need more seasoning.
<FACE,9,1>I did it! I am so great!
<FACE,10,1>Thanks! I'm sure you'll get tougher, too.
<FACE,21,0>You disappoint me. It's futile for you to try for the top at your
skill level.
<FACE,23,0>That was close. I wonder what it is that you lack.
<FACE,32,2>You lack disciplined training!
<FACE,53,1>Hoo hah!
<FACE,29,0>That's about what I expected.
<FACE,61,2>That was close. Want to try again?

<FACE,42,1>Hee, hee... Sorry.
<FACE,6,1>How's that? You're no match for me at all.
<FACE,7,0>All my POKÈMON are impressive.
<FACE,25,1>Thank you, thank you!
<FACE,2,1>So? Had enough?
<FACE,52,0>Close, but no cookie. Try harder next time, dear.
<FACE,8,1>Yes, my babies! You were awesome!
<FACE,38,1>I told you so. It's my win.
<FACE,28,0>Thank you! That was a memorable match!
<FACE,58,1>It feels like I'm lifting off in flight.
<FACE,9,1>That was a foregone conclusion.
<FACE,60,1>Mmm. What a haul, what a haul...
<FACE,17,1>Yeah, sorry about that. I've got to win.
<FACE,55,1>Extreme! Aren't I tough?
<FACE,10,1>Well, I think you did quite fine yourself.
<FACE,58,1>Fantastic! Bird POKÈMON are the greatest!
<FACE,18,2>Whew! That was a good battle.
<FACE,39,1>I did it! See? Didn't I tell you they were tough?
<FACE,13,0>Oh, wow! We won!
<FACE,59,2>See? Aren't bug POKÈMON tough?
<FACE,38,2>My darling POKÈMON are more than just cute.
<FACE,41,1>Oh! Oh, my! I won! Sorry, sweetie.
<FACE,0,1>What's wrong? I mean, your POKÈMON are good...
<FACE,5,0>I am grateful for this.
<FACE,22,0>You haven't learned to focus your mind!
<FACE,36,0>How unfortunate. But it's not enough.
<FACE,28,0>Yes, sir! That's the reward for my dedication to training!
<FACE,54,2>There. Do you realize how much more powerful I am than you?
<FACE,37,0>Thank you so much.
<FACE,48,2>Now get lost!
<FACE,47,1>Yes! I'm that much closer to becoming an EXECUTIVE!
<FACE,45,1>That was a wasted battle.
<FACE,46,0>What do you think? International-level POKÈMON are marvelous,
aren't they?
<FACE,3,0>All right then. Time for another run!
<FACE,55,1>Yahoo! Hey, this might be more fun than skiing.
<FACE,63,0>You have raw potential, but you need more seasoning.
<FACE,9,1>I did it! I am so great!
<FACE,10,1>Thanks! I'm sure you'll get tougher, too.
<FACE,21,0>You disappoint me. It's futile for you to try for the top at your
skill level.
<FACE,23,0>That was close. I wonder what it is that you lack.
<FACE,32,2>You lack disciplined training!
<FACE,53,1>Hoo hah!
<FACE,29,0>That's about what I expected.
<FACE,61,2>That was close. Want to try again?
<FACE,35,1>Thank you for a good battle!
<FACE,40,2>This turned out exactly as I had predicted.
<FACE,30,1>See? Didn't I tell you that I'm better than you?
<FACE,11,1>I thank you for your demonstration.
<FACE,1,1>I did it! Not too shabby!
<FACE,56,2>Defense is crucial, after all.
<FACE,31,2>How do you like feeling the true power of BLAINE, the firebrand
trainer!
<FACE,15,2>Sorry to say it, but this is it for you.
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,39,1>That's what you get for making fun of bug POKÈMON.
<FACE,26,0>I'm blissfully exhausted, like after a good swim.
<FACE,62,0>Gah, ha, ha! Come up and see me again!
<FACE,50,2>My logic is perfect! I don't like to battle, but I absolutely will
not lose!
<FACE,41,1>Don't be so hard on yourself.
<FACE,27,0>That's it. Bye!
<FACE,3,0>Better think up some measures against ice.
<FACE,44,0>Yes. Just as I predicted. I foresaw the expression you have now.
<FACE,7,0>We won! Oh, I'm so glad! Thank you, everyone!
<FACE,57,1>Ha, ha, ha--yeah! I sure am tough, ain't I?
<FACE,19,0>That was so hot!
<FACE,4,2>Ptooey! Heh, that was dull.
<FACE,52,0>What did you do wrong? Your homework is to figure that out.
<FACE,8,1>Mmm... Beautiful and strong, too! How sweet it is!
<FACE,5,0>Thank you for this opportunity.
<FACE,34,1>Hmm... That was inspiring. Such a neat victory.
<FACE,39,1>That's what you get for making fun of bug POKÈMON.
<FACE,26,0>I'm blissfully exhausted, like after a good swim.
<FACE,62,0>Gah, ha, ha! Come up and see me again!

<FACE,5,0>Thank you for this opportunity.
<FACE,34,1>Hmm... That was inspiring. Such a neat victory.
<FACE,6,1>See? Aren't my POKÈMON tough? 
<FACE,22,2>Ihihihi...
<FACE,46,0>Learn not to resist us.
<FACE,42,2>Sorry I beat you. But your POKÈMON are cute.
<FACE,16,1>...And the power chord to end the show! Come on, let's hear it for
me! Encore, encore!
<FACE,12,1>Wah, ha, ha! I say, you didn't have much of an impact.
<FACE,45,0>You made me get serious. That's something to be proud of.
<FACE,24,1>I wonder which country I should visit next?
<FACE,13,0>We won. Good for us!
<FACE,60,1>It feels great to win a battle!
<FACE,25,1>Ha, ha, ha... Give up?
<FACE,2,1>See? Aren't my POKÈMON tough?
<FACE,43,0>Oh, sorry I beat you. Don't give up!
<FACE,33,1>Wouldn't you agree that I am quite good?
<FACE,17,1>Ha, ha, ha... My hypothesis was correct.
<FACE,14,0>Hmm... Good battle. You were outstanding.
<FACE,6,1>See? Aren't my POKÈMON tough? 
<FACE,22,2>Ihihihi...
<FACE,46,0>Learn not to resist us.
<FACE,42,2>Sorry I beat you. But your POKÈMON are cute.

<FACE,57,1>I won! I won! Ha, ha, ha! I won!
<FACE,42,1>Hee, hee... Sorry.
<FACE,6,1>How's that? You're no match for me at all.
<FACE,7,0>All my POKÈMON are impressive.
<FACE,25,1>Thank you, thank you!
<FACE,2,1>So? Had enough?
<FACE,52,0>Close, but no cookie. Try harder next time, dear.
<FACE,8,1>Yes, my babies! You were awesome!
<FACE,38,1>I told you so. It's my win.

<FACE,55,1>Extreme! Aren't I tough?
<FACE,10,1>Well, I think you did quite fine yourself.
<FACE,51,2>Do you see? I'm the best!
<FACE,6,1>See? Aren't GRASS-type POKÈMON tough?
<FACE,50,1>The secret behind my power? ...I can't tell you that.
<FACE,25,1>Did you successfully exploit weaknesses?
<FACE,26,1>The plan worked! I hope I get extra credit!
<FACE,57,1>Ha, ha, ha! It took the shot without blinking! Isn't its power
awesome?
<FACE,42,1><FACE,42,1>See? Isn't <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> amazing?
<FACE,38,2><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DOUBLE TEAM<COL1,POP>'s effect can be lifted.
I've heard that there's a move that can do that.
<FACE,34,0>All my POKÈMON know how to <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SLEEP TALK<COL1,POP>.
<FACE,33,1>We play with our POKÈMON every day.
<FACE,38,1><COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>GYARADOS<COL1,POP> is my ace POKÈMON!
<FACE,57,1>It's a move that combines both defense and offense!
<FACE,25,1>Perfection!
<FACE,10,1>The items that POKÈMON hold are pretty important.
<FACE,9,1>It could have been dangerous if you had used <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>ENDURE<COL1,POP> smartly.
Oh, um... Never mind.
<FACE,24,0>Didn't I tell you? You don't stand a chance if you can't pull off
combos.
<FACE,2,1>When it rains,  <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>THUNDER<COL1,POP> always rolls!

<FACE,20,2>Work on your skills at the STADIUM, then come back and see me.
<FACE,58,2>Maybe you should retrain your POKÈMON.
<FACE,18,2>You did pretty well, too.
<FACE,39,2>I'd better take them home and let them rest... What? You want to
battle again?
<FACE,13,0>Uh-oh!
<FACE,59,2>Things just didn't go your way, did they?
<FACE,38,1>Ha, ha, ha! How disappointing for you.
<FACE,41,1>I hope you get better.
<FACE,0,0>What do you say? I'm darn tough, hey?
<FACE,5,0>I still need much training.
<FACE,22,0>Not good enough! You've much to learn!
<FACE,36,0>In addition to strengthening your POKÈMON's moves, you must
also strengthen your own soul.
<FACE,28,0>Wah, ha, ha, ha! It's all about power! Power!
<FACE,54,1>That's it! I win! I enjoyed that!
<FACE,37,0>I never expected to win.
<FACE,48,2>Don't get any more funny ideas!
<FACE,47,1>Yes! I'd better report this to my boss!
<FACE,45,1>This isn't the place for someone like you!
<FACE,46,0>May I invite you to join TEAM ROCKET for a career in crime?
<FACE,3,1>You've got all the substance of slush!
<FACE,55,1>Now that that's done, I can get back to the slopes.
<FACE,63,0>Think about your mistakes.
<FACE,9,1>Thank you. I didn't learn much from this, though.
<FACE,10,2>Well, I'd better go look for my next opponent.
<FACE,21,0>I'm having a hard time understanding how you could have come
this far.
<FACE,23,0>Sorry about that, but I'm shooting for the top myself.
<FACE,32,2>Have you learned to fear the techniques of the ninja?
<FACE,53,1>Now do you understand?!? That's the real power of the
ELITE FOUR!
<FACE,29,0>Well, that was relatively entertaining.
<FACE,61,2>I successfully defended my CHAMPIONSHIP.
<FACE,35,1>Hey, wasn't that electrifying?
<FACE,40,1>Your power is quite considerable.
<FACE,30,1>MISTY's number one! Ha, HA!
<FACE,11,1>Thank you for bearing with me.
<FACE,1,1>Heh! Sure, winning makes me happy.
<FACE,56,1>Yeah, that was quite fun.
<FACE,31,2>Come on, you! Be more passionate! Feel the burn!
<FACE,15,1>See? My power is what got me here.
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,51,2>The bottom line is that you can't beat me, no matter what you do.
<FACE,39,1>Waaah! Did I win? I won, didn't I?
<FACE,26,0>I was just goofin' around, but I won anyway. I guess you're
just weak.
<FACE,62,0>Wah, ha, ha! I was going to let you win!
<FACE,50,2>You can't win because you rely solely on instinct.
<FACE,41,1>The way you battle is really nice.
<FACE,27,0>See ya!
<FACE,3,0>Totally exhilarating, man.
<FACE,44,0>People don't seem to understand how powerful psychics are.
<FACE,7,0>Are your POKÈMON all right?
<FACE,57,1>Yeah. You're not too bad yourself.
<FACE,19,0>It's a fiery victory!
<FACE,4,1>Wah, ha, ha! Why don't you call your mommy for help?
<FACE,52,0>I should have gone easier on you. Sorry!
<FACE,8,2>Oh, how cute! What? Who says someone like me can't say "cute"?
<FACE,5,0>I will face you as often as you wish.
<FACE,34,1>When it comes down to the wire, my POKÈMON become even more
wonderful.
<FACE,39,1>Waaah! Did I win? I won, didn't I?
<FACE,26,0>I was just goofin' around, but I won anyway. I guess you're

<FACE,34,1>When it comes down to the wire, my POKÈMON become even more
wonderful.
<FACE,6,1>If you want tough POKÈMON, you should go to the seas and
mountains.
<FACE,22,2>No challenge were you to me in battle...
<FACE,48,1>You did the best you could, eh?
<FACE,42,2>You should let your POKÈMON spend some more time outside.
<FACE,16,1>Come see my next live gig. I'll sneak ya in through the back door.
<FACE,12,1>We won't be departing anytime soon. I'll take you on anytime!
<FACE,47,1>We don't need weaklings like you in TEAM ROCKET.
<FACE,24,1>Were you taking that battle seriously? You must have
underestimated me.
<FACE,13,0>JAN and JANE. We're strong!
<FACE,60,1>I feel like I've just landed a big one!
<FACE,25,1>I did it! Now I'm cool!
<FACE,2,1>It doesn't matter how you battle--a win is a win.
<FACE,43,0>You're pretty good yourself. You just need to apply yourself a
little harder.
<FACE,33,1>Don't you think you should be a little more diligent and
determined?
<FACE,17,1>Maybe this will persuade them to raise my research budget.
<FACE,14,0>I forgot about my age and became serious. I owe it all to you.
<FACE,6,1>If you want tough POKÈMON, you should go to the seas and

<FACE,57,1>Ha, ha, ha! I'm gonna tell all my friends!
<FACE,42,1>Ahhh... That was so refreshing.
<FACE,6,1>My training is so much better than yours.
<FACE,7,0>You worked so hard, everyone!
<FACE,25,1>Wow... That's perplexing. I won!
<FACE,2,1>That was perfect. Amazing, don't you think?
<FACE,52,0>I battled as hard as I could, too.
<FACE,8,1>Ohhhh... I'm... I'm all choked up...
<FACE,38,1>Tough, aren't I? Does it tick you off?
<FACE,28,0>Nice one! It's the ultimate!
<FACE,58,1>You're never going to beat me that way.
<FACE,9,1>For some reason, I don't feel like I've battled.
<FACE,60,1>Your view of the situation must've been too narrow.
<FACE,17,1>Boy, am I glad! Now I can go home proudly.
<FACE,55,1>I ended up winning! Maybe you don't have the talent...
<FACE,10,1>That was great for practice. Bye now.
<FACE,58,2>Maybe you should retrain your POKÈMON.
<FACE,18,2>You did pretty well, too.
<FACE,39,2>I'd better take them home and let them rest... What? You want to

<FACE,25,1>I did it! Now I'm cool!
<FACE,2,1>It doesn't matter how you battle--a win is a win.
<FACE,43,0>You're pretty good yourself. You just need to apply yourself a
little harder.
<FACE,33,1>Don't you think you should be a little more diligent and
determined?
<FACE,17,1>Maybe this will persuade them to raise my research budget.
<FACE,14,0>I forgot about my age and became serious. I owe it all to you.
<FACE,57,1>Ha, ha, ha! I'm gonna tell all my friends!
<FACE,42,1>Ahhh... That was so refreshing.
<FACE,6,1>My training is so much better than yours.
<FACE,7,0>You worked so hard, everyone!
<FACE,25,1>Wow... That's perplexing. I won!
<FACE,2,1>That was perfect. Amazing, don't you think?
<FACE,52,0>I battled as hard as I could, too.
<FACE,8,1>Ohhhh... I'm... I'm all choked up...
<FACE,38,1>Tough, aren't I? Does it tick you off?
<FACE,28,0>Nice one! It's the ultimate!
<FACE,58,1>You're never going to beat me that way.
<FACE,9,1>For some reason, I don't feel like I've battled.
<FACE,60,1>Your view of the situation must've been too narrow.
<FACE,17,1>Boy, am I glad! Now I can go home proudly.
<FACE,55,1>I ended up winning! Maybe you don't have the talent...
<FACE,10,1>That was great for practice. Bye now.
<FACE,51,2>The bottom line is that you can't beat me, no matter what you do.
<FACE,6,1>GRASS-type POKÈMON match up favorably against many other
POKÈMON types.
<FACE,50,1>How do you like the power of FIRE-type POKÈMON? Hee, hee...
<FACE,25,1>That was a textbook battle.
<FACE,26,0>Defense is the greatest offense!
<FACE,57,1>Nothing can dodge this move! It's a knockout every time!
<FACE,42,1><COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP> makes my SPECIAL DEFENSE complete!
<FACE,38,1>I've heard that <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SWIFT<COL1,POP> never misses. Is that true?
<FACE,34,0>As long as you don't pull any funny stuff, there's no question
that I'll win!
<FACE,33,1>My POKÈMON are adept at using DREAM EATER.
<FACE,38,1><COL1,PUSH,207,134,251,255>MAGCARGO<COL1,POP> is my trump card POKÈMON.
<FACE,57,1>As promised, I knocked your socks off!
<FACE,25,1>I did it! A victory of brain over brawn!
<FACE,10,2>Apparently, some items have no effect unless they are held by
certain POKÈMON.
<FACE,9,1>Ha, ha, ha! That was a cakewalk!
<FACE,24,0>Why don't you join me on the road? I could teach you about
combos.
<FACE,2,1>No, no. Not a chance. You'll never beat me that way!

<FACE,20,2>You can get lessons on battle techniques.
<FACE,58,1>Your POKÈMON aren't bad at all.
<FACE,18,2>Bird POKÈMON are the best after all!
<FACE,39,2>I think you should study a bit more.
<FACE,13,0>Are you surprised?
<FACE,59,1>My research is correct!
<FACE,38,2>Would you like to challenge me again?
<FACE,41,1>You're trying to become the CHAMPION, aren't you? Go for it!
<FACE,0,1>I wonder if there's anyone anywhere who's tougher than me?
<FACE,5,0>You should return later.
<FACE,22,0>Come again another time.
<FACE,36,0>If the trainer isn't focused, his POKÈMON can't concentrate,
either.
<FACE,28,0>Hi-yah! Might makes right!
<FACE,54,2>That was like a pillow fight.
<FACE,37,0>I was merely lucky.
<FACE,48,2>Don't try to stop TEAM ROCKET!
<FACE,47,1>Yes! My future looks bright!
<FACE,45,1>Have you considered giving up?
<FACE,46,0>You may have the qualities to become an EXECUTIVE.
<FACE,3,0>I feel like I nailed a 1080∫!
<FACE,55,2>My POKÈMON are spectacular, aren't they?
<FACE,63,0>The anger of losing will spur you to work harder.
<FACE,9,2>Your power? Eh, I'd say it's all right. For what it is...
<FACE,10,2>You know, you're not necessarily a bad trainer.
<FACE,21,0>I would say you're ten years too early to be challenging the
ELITE FOUR.
<FACE,23,0>I never thought you could come this far.
<FACE,32,2>You expect to battle the ELITE FOUR with your current skills?
<FACE,53,1>You can challenge me all you like, but the results will never
change!
<FACE,29,0>Come visit me anytime.
<FACE,61,2>It's not that you are weak. Don't let it bother you.
<FACE,35,1>Nice one! My POKÈMON have become even mightier!
<FACE,40,1>There is no need to be saddened by your loss.
<FACE,30,2>You weren't too bad yourself.
<FACE,11,1>It became a match I won't forget.
<FACE,1,1>There, there. It went just as I expected. I'll battle someone
tougher next time.
<FACE,56,1>You're tough, too. And you've got the potential to get even
better.
<FACE,31,2>Fire symbolizes our burning ambition!
<FACE,15,2>It all comes down to your sense of balance.
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,51,2>You're wasting your time playing with those wimpy POKÈMON.
<FACE,39,1>What do you think about my battle technique? Did you learn
anything?
<FACE,26,1>You're not even good to practice on. I'll go challenge one of
these other trainers.
<FACE,62,0>Wah, ha, ha! I don't care about winning or losing!
<FACE,50,2>I think that you need to study a whole lot more.
<FACE,41,1>Maybe I was unfairly harsh on a young person like you.
<FACE,27,0>Buh-bye!
<FACE,3,0>Scored a "ten"! Maximum cool!
<FACE,44,0>Sorry, but don't talk to me. I'm completely exhausted.
<FACE,7,0>Now let's go home for dinner.
<FACE,57,2>What? Is that all? I want to battle someone tougher.
<FACE,19,0>That was hot!
<FACE,4,2>Some opponent you were! Learned your lesson, eh?
<FACE,52,0>You have to try harder. I'll be cheering you on!
<FACE,8,1>I don't care about the match! My POKÈMON!
<FACE,5,0>That was an honorable battle.
<FACE,34,1>Ooh, that was so, like, subtle and deep. Don't you think it was a
memorable battle?
<FACE,39,1>What do you think about my battle technique? Did you learn
anything?
<FACE,26,1>You're not even good to practice on. I'll go challenge one of

<FACE,5,0>That was an honorable battle.
<FACE,34,1>Ooh, that was so, like, subtle and deep. Don't you think it was a
memorable battle?
<FACE,6,1>I won! It was bound to happen, really. Your training was no match
for mine.
<FACE,22,2>However often we meet, the outcome never shall change.
<FACE,48,1>Why are you still wandering around? Get lost!
<FACE,42,2>After a battle, we take a nap on the grass.
<FACE,16,2>Want to meet the members of my band?
<FACE,12,2>You can hear strange cries at night while on a cruise. Want to
hear them?
<FACE,47,1>I'm finished with you.
<FACE,24,1>I'm pleased with how that turned out. I hope to build on my
success.
<FACE,13,0>We won! That was really exciting.
<FACE,60,1>If you use good equipment, your technique will improve.
<FACE,25,1>Yes! I'm gonna go brag to all my friends!
<FACE,2,1>Well, I'm going for a swim! Thanks for playing!
<FACE,43,0>That was like an open-and-shut case. Thanks for your
cooperation!
<FACE,33,1>I can finally beat someone. I'm delighted!
<FACE,17,1>Did you see the fruits of my research?
<FACE,14,0>Thank you. I understand that there are magnificent trainers

<FACE,57,1>I did it. That's so cool!
<FACE,42,1>I guess this demonstrates our skill levels.
<FACE,6,1>Heh, that was so-so.
<FACE,7,0>Oh, you all look so happy!
<FACE,25,1>Well, I might not be so bad after all.
<FACE,2,1>Oh, there's no reason to be that disappointed.
<FACE,52,0>I hope the experience you've gained here will help you in your
next battle.
<FACE,8,1>Happy! I'm just... Totally happy!
<FACE,38,1>Thank you. I think you can get much better, too.
<FACE,28,0>I'll always dedicate myself to fighting POKÈMON!
<FACE,58,1>Did you have a proper strategy worked out?
<FACE,9,1>That was quite good. You should keep working at this, too.
<FACE,60,1>My feelings are on the up and up!
<FACE,17,1>I know, you tried your best.
<FACE,55,1>I'm really happy! Thanks so much!
<FACE,10,1>You came this close. There's no need to be disappointed.

<FACE,6,1>Did you see that? The GRASS-type is the best!
<FACE,50,1>Ha, ha, ha! Everything went according to logic!
<FACE,25,2>If you want to beat me, you'll have to attack my weak points
precisely.
<FACE,26,1>Wasn't that a good plan? I wish I had shown it to a lady
SWIMMER...
<FACE,57,1>Ha, ha, ha! I told you you couldn't dodge it!
<FACE,42,1>With <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP>, SPECIAL DEFENSE is assured!
<FACE,38,2>I think that there are moves that restore elusiveness to normal.
<FACE,34,1>Actually, I even taught it <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SLEEP TALK<COL1,POP>.
<FACE,33,1>Could your POKÈMON be holding items that aren't appropriate?
<FACE,38,2>Whew, I'm all sweaty. Wasn't that a good battle?
<FACE,57,1>Heh. Makes it hard to attack, doesn't it?
<FACE,25,1>I won again! You obviously haven't done your homework.
<FACE,10,1>...Your POKÈMON are holding some nice items.
<FACE,9,2>If you get hit squarely by <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>HYPER BEAM<COL1,POP>, of course you're going
to lose.
<FACE,24,0>Heh, what do you know? I started studying battle strategies only
recently.
<FACE,2,1>See? Didn't <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>MINIMIZE<COL1,POP> make it hard to hit my POKÈMON?

<FACE,20,1>You did it! Now you can aim for the CHAMPIONSHIP.
<FACE,58,2>I'm still going to continue living with these guys.
<FACE,18,0>What'll you do if my POKÈMON's wings get damaged?!?
<FACE,39,2>Hmm. I need to train them better...
<FACE,13,0>Oh, dear. We lost!
<FACE,59,0>I was just unlucky.
<FACE,38,0>Ahhh... My poor POKÈMON...
<FACE,41,1>That's good. That's the way to do it.
<FACE,0,2>...sob... You didn't have to play so rough!
<FACE,5,0>I am grateful for this.
<FACE,22,1>Oh... I'm shattered...
<FACE,36,0>That's good. The POKÈMON look happy, too.
<FACE,28,1>Waaaah! Why?!?
<FACE,54,0>Why...!?! All right, then! I'll raise my POKÈMON to be even
stronger!
<FACE,37,0>I hope you do as well in your next battle.
<FACE,48,0>Wh-wh-what?!? Bad news!
<FACE,47,0>You vermin! I won't forsake my dream over this!
<FACE,45,0>You're good. Why don't you join TEAM ROCKET?
<FACE,46,0>This does not mean that you have dashed our grand designs.
<FACE,3,2>Shoot! Well then, I'm switching to summer. Watch me as a SWIMMER!
<FACE,55,0>Aiyee! That was no fun! I'm hitting the slopes.
<FACE,63,0>Outstanding! That was perfect. Try not to forget what you
feel now.
<FACE,9,0>I'm furious! I can't help myself--losing steams me!
<FACE,10,0>I surrender! I was totally defeated!
<FACE,21,0>I'm amazed... I never expected anyone to beat me...
<FACE,23,0>I'm impressed. I have no regrets about this. Go on ahead.
<FACE,32,2>Never have I met the likes of you.
<FACE,53,0>Why!?! This just can't be happening!
<FACE,29,0>The CHAMPION is looking forward to meeting you.
<FACE,61,2>You got me. You are magnificent!
<FACE,35,0>Okay! I'll have to go back to camp and brush up on my training.
<FACE,40,2>I never envisioned this happening.
<FACE,30,0>Aiyeee! That makes me so angry!
<FACE,11,2>Your skills surpass mine. I concede defeat.
<FACE,1,0>Why? How could this happen?
<FACE,56,2>How could anyone break through my rock-hard defense...
<FACE,31,2>I burnt out... There's nothing but ashes left...
<FACE,15,0>Lost? I lost? No way!
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,51,0>What... Why?!? This should have been perfect!
<FACE,39,0>Shoot! I choked!
<FACE,26,1>Argh... I should become a BOARDER and wait for winter.
<FACE,62,0>Gah, ha, ha! It's no big deal! ...On second thought, rats!
<FACE,50,0>Eeeek! How did my logic fail me?
<FACE,41,1>Yes, you sure are tough. Keep it up!
<FACE,27,0>Run away!
<FACE,3,1>How about that? Eh, it's no big deal.
<FACE,44,0>I never predicted I would lose. Is it impossible to see one's
own fate?
<FACE,7,1>My poor POKÈMON...
<FACE,57,0>Rats! I'm going to catch some more POKÈMON.
<FACE,19,0>Going down in flames!
<FACE,4,0>I'm sorry! I won't be bad again!
<FACE,52,0>You're really gifted! What school did you say you're from?
<FACE,8,0>You monster! Savage! How could you do such a thing!
<FACE,5,0>I will return.
<FACE,34,2>Waaah! My POKÈMON! You're so mean!
<FACE,39,0>Shoot! I choked!
<FACE,26,1>Argh... I should become a BOARDER and wait for winter.
<FACE,62,0>Gah, ha, ha! It's no big deal! ...On second thought, rats!

own fate?
<FACE,7,1>My poor POKÈMON...
<FACE,57,0>Rats! I'm going to catch some more POKÈMON.
<FACE,19,0>Going down in flames!
<FACE,4,0>I'm sorry! I won't be bad again!
<FACE,52,0>You're really gifted! What school did you say you're from?
<FACE,8,0>You monster! Savage! How could you do such a thing!
<FACE,5,0>I will return.
<FACE,34,2>Waaah! My POKÈMON! You're so mean!
<FACE,6,0>How could this happen? I trained really, really hard.
<FACE,22,1>Hee, hee, hee...
<FACE,48,0>No way! This couldn't have happened!
<FACE,42,0>Huh? It's over already? That makes me so angry!
<FACE,16,0>I'll just go home and work on a ballad.
<FACE,12,0>I blew it! I'll have to refine my skills by battling my shipmates.
<FACE,47,0>No way! Bad news!
<FACE,24,0>I can't go home like this...
<FACE,13,0>JAN and JANE, did we lose?
<FACE,60,0>I feel as if a big one got away and took my rod with it...
<FACE,25,0>Okay! I'm going to become strong like you!
<FACE,2,0>It doesn't matter. No big deal. I still love these babies.
<FACE,43,0>What's that? You've seen a BURGLAR around here?
<FACE,33,2>What should I do? My mother will be disappointed.
<FACE,17,0>Waaah! I sneaked out of the lab for this... The chief's going to
chew me out again...
<FACE,14,0>Although I lost, I feel exhilarated. Thank you.
<FACE,6,0>How could this happen? I trained really, really hard.
<FACE,22,1>Hee, hee, hee...
<FACE,48,0>No way! This couldn't have happened!
<FACE,42,0>Huh? It's over already? That makes me so angry!
<FACE,16,0>I'll just go home and work on a ballad.
<FACE,12,0>I blew it! I'll have to refine my skills by battling my shipmates.

<FACE,25,0>Okay! I'm going to become strong like you!
<FACE,2,0>It doesn't matter. No big deal. I still love these babies.
<FACE,43,0>What's that? You've seen a BURGLAR around here?
<FACE,33,2>What should I do? My mother will be disappointed.
<FACE,17,0>Waaah! I sneaked out of the lab for this... The chief's going to
chew me out again...
<FACE,14,0>Although I lost, I feel exhilarated. Thank you.
<FACE,57,0>Awww, shucks! That was so close!
<FACE,42,0>I feel like I blew it...
<FACE,6,0>Why? What went wrong?
<FACE,7,1>Oh... Why are you so rough?
<FACE,25,0>I'll get my tutor to teach me some more about this.
<FACE,2,0>Awwww! I lost it.
<FACE,52,0>You're a genius. There isn't anything else that I could teach you.
<FACE,8,0>Waaaah! My POKÈMON...
<FACE,38,0>My poor POKÈMON...
<FACE,28,1>This must be some sort of mistake!
<FACE,58,0>Wait! Let's go again! That's not allowed?
<FACE,9,0>Arrrgh... I won't forgive you for this!
<FACE,60,0>Tch, lose to a kid like this?
<FACE,17,0>This, too, is a possible outcome. I have to accept this.
<FACE,55,0>Awwww. I'll go look for someone weaker.
<FACE,10,0>Arrrgh... Defeated!
<FACE,58,2>I'm still going to continue living with these guys.
<FACE,18,0>What'll you do if my POKÈMON's wings get damaged?!?
<FACE,39,2>Hmm. I need to train them better...
<FACE,13,0>Oh, dear. We lost!
<FACE,59,0>I was just unlucky.
<FACE,38,0>Ahhh... My poor POKÈMON...
<FACE,41,1>That's good. That's the way to do it.
<FACE,0,2>...sob... You didn't have to play so rough!
<FACE,5,0>I am grateful for this.
<FACE,22,1>Oh... I'm shattered...
<FACE,36,0>That's good. The POKÈMON look happy, too.
<FACE,28,1>Waaaah! Why?!?
<FACE,54,0>Why...!?! All right, then! I'll raise my POKÈMON to be even
stronger!
<FACE,37,0>I hope you do as well in your next battle.
<FACE,48,0>Wh-wh-what?!? Bad news!
<FACE,47,0>You vermin! I won't forsake my dream over this!
<FACE,45,0>You're good. Why don't you join TEAM ROCKET?
<FACE,46,0>This does not mean that you have dashed our grand designs.
<FACE,3,2>Shoot! Well then, I'm switching to summer. Watch me as a SWIMMER!
<FACE,55,0>Aiyee! That was no fun! I'm hitting the slopes.
<FACE,63,0>Outstanding! That was perfect. Try not to forget what you
feel now.
<FACE,9,0>I'm furious! I can't help myself--losing steams me!
<FACE,10,0>I surrender! I was totally defeated!
<FACE,21,0>I'm amazed... I never expected anyone to beat me...
<FACE,23,0>I'm impressed. I have no regrets about this. Go on ahead.
<FACE,32,2>Never have I met the likes of you.
<FACE,53,0>Why!?! This just can't be happening!
<FACE,29,0>The CHAMPION is looking forward to meeting you.
<FACE,61,2>You got me. You are magnificent!
<FACE,35,0>Okay! I'll have to go back to camp and brush up on my training.
<FACE,40,2>I never envisioned this happening.
<FACE,30,0>Aiyeee! That makes me so angry!
<FACE,11,2>Your skills surpass mine. I concede defeat.
<FACE,1,0>Why? How could this happen?
<FACE,56,2>How could anyone break through my rock-hard defense...
<FACE,31,2>I burnt out... There's nothing but ashes left...
<FACE,15,0>Lost? I lost? No way!
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,39,0>Shoot! I choked!
<FACE,26,1>Argh... I should become a BOARDER and wait for winter.
<FACE,62,0>Gah, ha, ha! It's no big deal! ...On second thought, rats!
<FACE,50,0>Eeeek! How did my logic fail me?
<FACE,41,1>Yes, you sure are tough. Keep it up!
<FACE,27,0>Run away!
<FACE,3,1>How about that? Eh, it's no big deal.
<FACE,44,0>I never predicted I would lose. Is it impossible to see one's
own fate?
<FACE,7,1>My poor POKÈMON...
<FACE,57,0>Rats! I'm going to catch some more POKÈMON.
<FACE,19,0>Going down in flames!
<FACE,4,0>I'm sorry! I won't be bad again!
<FACE,52,0>You're really gifted! What school did you say you're from?
<FACE,8,0>You monster! Savage! How could you do such a thing!
<FACE,5,0>I will return.
<FACE,34,2>Waaah! My POKÈMON! You're so mean!
<FACE,39,0>Shoot! I choked!
<FACE,26,1>Argh... I should become a BOARDER and wait for winter.
<FACE,62,0>Gah, ha, ha! It's no big deal! ...On second thought, rats!

<FACE,5,0>I will return.
<FACE,34,2>Waaah! My POKÈMON! You're so mean!
<FACE,6,0>How could this happen? I trained really, really hard.
<FACE,22,1>Hee, hee, hee...
<FACE,46,0>This is meaningless to us.
<FACE,42,0>Huh? It's over already? That makes me so angry!
<FACE,16,0>I'll just go home and work on a ballad.
<FACE,12,0>I blew it! I'll have to refine my skills by battling my shipmates.
<FACE,45,1>Waaaait! Who is this? This kid?
<FACE,24,0>I can't go home like this...
<FACE,13,0>JAN and JANE, did we lose?
<FACE,60,0>I feel as if a big one got away and took my rod with it...
<FACE,25,0>Okay! I'm going to become strong like you!

<FACE,10,0>Arrrgh... Defeated!
<FACE,51,0>What... Why?!? This should have been perfect!
<FACE,6,1>Waaah! You're better than me.
<FACE,50,0>Was there a type disadvantage? A chemical reaction might affect
my team...
<FACE,25,0>You know more about type alignments than I do?
<FACE,26,1>A move that isn't affected by defense... Is there such a thing?
<FACE,57,0>Huh? I lost? You're kidding, right?
<FACE,42,0>Waaaaah! I'm going to tell EARL!
<FACE,38,0>I... I lost. Sob... Just joking!
<FACE,34,2>Waaah! My POKÈMON! You're terrible!
<FACE,33,2>What should I do? My mother will be disappointed.
<FACE,38,0>You're joking! TAMMY can't lose...
<FACE,57,0>I got beaten! ...I guess I was a little too complacent.
<FACE,25,0>Whaaaat!?! Th-that's allowed?
<FACE,10,0>I'm going to learn from this and move on! ...What's that look
you're giving me?
<FACE,9,0>I'm so angry! I don't think I can eat tonight.
<FACE,24,1>I guess it's about time for me to move on from here...
<FACE,2,0>I've been attending the ACADEMY since I was little. It makes me
furious to lose!

<FACE,20,1>You're pretty tough. Keep sluggin' away!
<FACE,58,2>FALKNER is a lot tougher than I am.
<FACE,18,0>...Shoot! Yeah, I lost.
<FACE,39,2>Let's have another battle sometime.
<FACE,13,0>Uh-oh!
<FACE,59,2>I give up! You're tough.
<FACE,38,0>You didn't have to be so mean!
<FACE,41,1>You're strong. I like that.
<FACE,0,2>Waaaaah! I can't believe I lost!
<FACE,5,0>My training is insufficient.
<FACE,22,1>I'm exhausted, body and soul.
<FACE,36,0>I lost. I will have to increase my training.
<FACE,28,0>Aiyeee! I lost! We'll sprint back to the dojo as punishment!
<FACE,54,2>You're strong! Would you please make me your apprentice?
<FACE,37,1>You are truly strong. I'll have to try much harder, too.
<FACE,48,0>Oh, no! I'll have to report this! Come in...
<FACE,47,0>Complacency did me in! Guess I'd better report this.
<FACE,45,1>I won't be able to look my associates in the face after this!
<FACE,46,0>As reported, you are indeed talented.
<FACE,3,1>I'm out of here!
<FACE,55,2>I guess my plan just got swept away.
<FACE,63,0>Did you train all by yourself? That's incredible!
<FACE,9,0>I lost because of that one move. That has to be it.
<FACE,10,2>I'm sorry. I took you for granted, but you are tough after all.
<FACE,21,0>You're skilled enough to hold your own against the ELITE FOUR.
<FACE,23,0>Of all the opponents I've faced, you're the best without a doubt.
<FACE,32,2>It stands to reason that you defeated WILL!
<FACE,53,0>The world is huge! I must redo my training!
<FACE,29,0>No! I can't win. How did you become so strong?
<FACE,61,2>This is the emergence of a new CHAMPION.
<FACE,35,2>I don't believe this! I've been defeated?
<FACE,40,0>Psychic power isn't infallible...
<FACE,30,0>How could I lose to someone like you?!?
<FACE,11,2>Oh... How foolish of me.
<FACE,1,0>I can understand losing to Father, but losing to you?
<FACE,56,2>I was done in... I didn't know about that style of battling...
<FACE,31,2>Didn't I stoke the flames high enough?
<FACE,15,2>You really are tough. I have to hand it to you.
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,51,0>Are you happy that you won? Hmph! Sure. Go ahead and brag
about it.
<FACE,39,2>I guess these things happen.
<FACE,26,1>I was just goofin' around and ended up losing.
<FACE,62,0>Wah, ha, ha! I lost on purpose!
<FACE,50,2>My logic wasn't faulty! There must still be a missing element.
<FACE,41,1>Well, I'll be seeing you.
<FACE,27,0>Tch!
<FACE,3,1>Huh? You're all right.
<FACE,44,0>I had a feeling I would lose. I got it when I saw your POKÈMON.
<FACE,7,1>Oh, did that hurt? I'm so sorry. It's all Mommy's fault.
<FACE,57,0>Huh? I lost? You're kidding, right?
<FACE,19,0>Children shouldn't play with matches!
<FACE,4,0>I'll be back! Shoot!
<FACE,52,0>Oh my. I lost. It wasn't on purpose, either.
<FACE,8,0>Aaargh! My POKÈMON! I need a POKÈMON CENTER!
<FACE,5,0>That was a good experience for me.
<FACE,34,2>Wh-what have you done...? I'm speechless...
<FACE,39,2>I guess these things happen.
<FACE,26,1>I was just goofin' around and ended up losing.
<FACE,62,0>Wah, ha, ha! I lost on purpose!
<FACE,50,2>My logic wasn't faulty! There must still be a missing element.

<FACE,5,0>That was a good experience for me.
<FACE,34,2>Wh-what have you done...? I'm speechless...
<FACE,6,1>What? I lost? That's weird...
<FACE,22,0>The road to glory stretches far...
<FACE,48,0>What? This is bad news.
<FACE,42,2>I'll have to work much, much harder. That was good practice,
though.
<FACE,16,0>Fade out! You can't do that live, though.
<FACE,12,2>I've got to find tougher POKÈMON in foreign countries.
<FACE,47,2>You're tough. Come join TEAM ROCKET.
<FACE,24,0>If that's the way you want it, I'll SELFDESTRUCT with my
VOLTORB!
<FACE,13,0>Oh, we lost. We're so sad.
<FACE,60,0>My preparation was all wrong. I'll fix that for next time!
<FACE,25,0>That's strange... I did exactly as I was taught...
<FACE,2,2>You're really wild. I'm surprised!
<FACE,43,0>You're a tough one. Would you care to join the police force?
<FACE,33,0>I don't like inflexible people like you! I don't want to know you!
<FACE,17,2>What? Did I make an error? That's odd. I'll have to review my
research notes.
<FACE,14,0>I did the best I could, so I don't feel any resentment. You truly
are strong.
<FACE,6,1>What? I lost? That's weird...

<FACE,57,2>That's strange. I'm gonna catch better POKÈMON!
<FACE,42,0>Ow, ow, ow...
<FACE,6,1>I'd rather be camping!
<FACE,7,1>If a POKÈMON is cute, then that's good enough!
<FACE,25,0>Hmm... There must be something wrong with my combinations.
<FACE,2,0>I lost, didn't I...?
<FACE,52,0>Well done, dear. Keep up the good work.
<FACE,8,0>Okay, I get it! I lost! No more, please!
<FACE,38,0>Oh, no... That's so cruel...
<FACE,28,1>Please tell me this is a lie!
<FACE,58,2>I lost? Tch, I'll go play with these guys...
<FACE,9,2>This must mean that I still have much to learn.
<FACE,60,0>Gotta get home and get some rest...
<FACE,17,0>I've had a streak of bad luck.
<FACE,55,0>Oh, boring...
<FACE,10,0>That's disappointing after all the time I spent training.
<FACE,58,2>FALKNER is a lot tougher than I am.
<FACE,18,0>...Shoot! Yeah, I lost.

<FACE,44,0>I had a feeling I would lose. I got it when I saw your POKÈMON.
<FACE,7,1>Oh, did that hurt? I'm so sorry. It's all Mommy's fault.
<FACE,57,0>Huh? I lost? You're kidding, right?
<FACE,19,0>Children shouldn't play with matches!
<FACE,4,0>I'll be back! Shoot!
<FACE,52,0>Oh my. I lost. It wasn't on purpose, either.
<FACE,8,0>Aaargh! My POKÈMON! I need a POKÈMON CENTER!
<FACE,5,0>That was a good experience for me.
<FACE,34,2>Wh-what have you done...? I'm speechless...
<FACE,6,1>What? I lost? That's weird...
<FACE,22,0>The road to glory stretches far...
<FACE,46,0>Well, I wish you all the best of much-needed luck.
<FACE,42,2>I'll have to work much, much harder. That was good practice,
though.
<FACE,16,0>Fade out! You can't do that live, though.
<FACE,12,2>I've got to find tougher POKÈMON in foreign countries.
<FACE,45,1>I must be dreaming this.
<FACE,24,0>If that's the way you want it, I'll SELFDESTRUCT with my
VOLTORB!
<FACE,13,0>Oh, we lost. We're so sad.
<FACE,60,0>My preparation was all wrong. I'll fix that for next time!
<FACE,25,0>That's strange... I did exactly as I was taught...
<FACE,2,2>You're really wild. I'm surprised!
<FACE,43,0>You're a tough one. Would you care to join the police force?
<FACE,33,0>I don't like inflexible people like you! I don't want to know you!
<FACE,17,2>What? Did I make an error? That's odd. I'll have to review my
research notes.
<FACE,14,0>I did the best I could, so I don't feel any resentment. You truly
are strong.
<FACE,6,1>What? I lost? That's weird...

<FACE,14,0>I did the best I could, so I don't feel any resentment. You truly

<FACE,57,2>That's strange. I'm gonna catch better POKÈMON!
<FACE,42,0>Ow, ow, ow...
<FACE,6,1>I'd rather be camping!
<FACE,7,1>If a POKÈMON is cute, then that's good enough!
<FACE,25,0>Hmm... There must be something wrong with my combinations.
<FACE,2,0>I lost, didn't I...?
<FACE,52,0>Well done, dear. Keep up the good work.
<FACE,8,0>Okay, I get it! I lost! No more, please!
<FACE,38,0>Oh, no... That's so cruel...
<FACE,28,1>Please tell me this is a lie!
<FACE,58,2>I lost? Tch, I'll go play with these guys...
<FACE,9,2>This must mean that I still have much to learn.
<FACE,60,0>Gotta get home and get some rest...
<FACE,17,0>I've had a streak of bad luck.
<FACE,55,0>Oh, boring...
<FACE,10,0>That's disappointing after all the time I spent training.
<FACE,51,0>Are you happy that you won? Hmph! Sure. Go ahead and brag
about it.
<FACE,6,1>Waaah! You taught me a lesson instead!
<FACE,50,2>Maybe they went wild from the intense heat...
<FACE,25,0>That's strange... I did exactly as I was taught...
<FACE,26,1>Snivel... My plan failed...
<FACE,57,2>Those were my favorite moves...
<FACE,42,0>Aaah! That's so annoying. After all the effort of using <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>AMNESIA<COL1,POP>!
<FACE,38,0>You did it... Grrrrr...
<FACE,34,2>You... You did some horrible things...
<FACE,33,0>I dislike brutes who combine items and moves. I don't want to play
with you!
<FACE,38,0>TAMMY lost? Unbelievable!
<FACE,57,2>What moves can be used against a POKÈMON that uses <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>FLY<COL1,POP> or <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>DIG<COL1,POP>?
I'm not telling!
<FACE,25,0>That's strange... I did exactly as I was taught...
<FACE,10,2>What? How could you battle that way? I... I can't believe it...
<FACE,9,0>You're atrocious! I'm going to tell EARL!
<FACE,24,1>I just got here... How could I lose so quickly?
<FACE,2,2>Of course, I also like sunny days. Then I can go swimming!

<FACE,20,1>There are many trainers at the STADIUM who are much stronger.
<FACE,58,2>Hmm. You raised your POKÈMON better than I did mine.
<FACE,18,1>Can't I win using only FLYING-type POKÈMON?
<FACE,39,2>I didn't expect this to happen...
<FACE,13,0>We were surprised.
<FACE,59,2>I need to do some more research.
<FACE,38,0>Hmph! I'm not upset!
<FACE,41,1>I'll play with you again.
<FACE,0,2>Waaah! Waaah! You're so mean!
<FACE,5,0>I must meditate over this.
<FACE,22,1>This is not good. I must try again...
<FACE,36,0>That's how to do it. I look forward to seeing you become even
stronger.
<FACE,28,1>Arrrgh! How humiliating!
<FACE,54,0>I lost! I... I lost! Me!
<FACE,37,1>Perhaps I should step down as a GYM LEADER...
<FACE,48,0>Who in the world are you?
<FACE,47,2>Maybe I should go back home...
<FACE,45,1>Well, isn't that a bummer!
<FACE,46,0>It pains me to see your talent go to waste!
<FACE,3,2>I should've known--it's all about balance...
<FACE,55,2>No matter how much I fall, I just keep bouncing back for more...
<FACE,63,0>Yes, I think that you have the potential to climb even higher.
<FACE,9,0>I've never been beaten this way.
<FACE,10,2>I suppose there must be many tough trainers.
<FACE,21,0>I wonder how far you can go at your skill level. This should be
fascinating.
<FACE,23,0>I've expended all my power. I have no regrets about losing
this way.
<FACE,32,2>I, too, must pursue further discipline.
<FACE,53,1>Your next adversary, KAREN, has a battle style that is entirely
unlike mine. Now what will you do?
<FACE,29,0>I will not stray from my chosen path.
<FACE,61,2>I never expected another trainer to beat me... I'm surprised.
<FACE,35,2>This must be a bad dream.
<FACE,40,2>I am not embittered by this. I knew it was coming...
<FACE,30,2>No! I was no match for you at all. Who are you?
<FACE,11,2>There will be days like this.
<FACE,1,2>Aren't you something. Where did you train?
<FACE,56,2>The world is huge! I'm glad to have met you.
<FACE,31,2>I'll go back and work on my basic skills again.
<FACE,15,2>I've only lost to him and now to you... Him? Hee, hee...
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,51,0>What? What is it that I lack?
<FACE,39,2>Did I lose? You're joking, right?
<FACE,26,1>Okay! I'll be training in the tropical seas! Then again, I don't
have the travel budget!
<FACE,62,0>Wah, ha, ha! I don't care about winning or losing!
<FACE,50,2>Yeah, sure. Go on doing things in your savage way.
<FACE,41,1>Well, I guess the way you do things is all right.
<FACE,27,0>Work, work, work...
<FACE,3,1>Heh. These things happen.
<FACE,44,0>...Whatever... It doesn't matter...
<FACE,7,1>I hate battles! I'll never do it again!
<FACE,57,0>Beating me doesn't make you great!
<FACE,19,0>Fizzle...
<FACE,4,2>Don't get cocky just because you won!
<FACE,52,0>With your skill level, I can recommend you for national
tournaments.
<FACE,8,0>M-my POKÈMON... I f-feel f-faint... (Thud!)
<FACE,5,0>I will try never to forget what happened today.
<FACE,34,2>No... ...groan...
<FACE,39,2>Did I lose? You're joking, right?

<FACE,5,0>I will try never to forget what happened today.
<FACE,34,2>No... ...groan...
<FACE,6,1>Should I go look for stronger POKÈMON?
<FACE,22,0>It must be a mistake, this!
<FACE,48,2>Hmph. Happy now?
<FACE,42,2>That was fun. Thank you. I have to go outside now.
<FACE,16,2>Next time, I'll bring the whole band instead of playing solo.
<FACE,12,0>I feel like I was battered by vicious waves...
<FACE,47,2>Hmm... So there are kids like you...
<FACE,24,0>I should never have signed up for a tournament like this!
<FACE,13,0>That's a big no-no. You're strong.
<FACE,60,0>Battles are fun, but so is fishing. Join me sometime!
<FACE,25,0>Waaah! I wonder what I should tell my friends.
<FACE,2,2>If I had known this would happen, I would have gone for a swim
instead.
<FACE,43,0>Oops, my break is almost over. Thanks for your time.
<FACE,33,1>Please book us for a performance... How old did you say you were?
<FACE,17,0>What a disaster! I can't present this to the Academy...
<FACE,14,0>I feel fortunate to have met someone like you. Traveling is good
for me.

<FACE,42,2>I couldn't avoid that... Let's do this again.
<FACE,6,0>Tch! Tch, tch, tch!
<FACE,7,1>Oh, my... What am I to do?
<FACE,25,0>I'm going to be more diligent with my studies.
<FACE,2,2>I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.
<FACE,52,0>We should all be friends after battles.
<FACE,8,2>It doesn't matter if they lose...
<FACE,38,0>Whatever. It doesn't really matter if I win or not...
<FACE,28,1>I won't give up because of this!
<FACE,58,2>I don't care. So what if I lost? I still like bird POKÈMON.
<FACE,9,0>I'm going to use this disappointment to motivate me!
<FACE,60,0>Arrrgh... Just couldn't pull it off...
<FACE,17,0>I guess this is what they call a "loss"...
<FACE,55,0>I lost... Oh well, no biggie.
<FACE,10,1>Congratulations! You've conquered the PRIME CUP!
<FACE,58,2>Hmm. You raised your POKÈMON better than I did mine.

<FACE,51,0>What? What is it that I lack?
<FACE,6,1>Waaah! Maybe my team's type was a bad match for yours.
<FACE,50,0>I relied too much on a single type. I'm a failure as a scientist...
<FACE,25,0>Waaaaah! What am I going to tell my friends?
<FACE,26,0>Okay! I'll be training in the tropical seas! Then again, I don't
have the travel budget!
<FACE,57,2>I relied too heavily on <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SOLARBEAM<COL1,POP> and <COL1,PUSH,146,195,255,255>SKULL BASH<COL1,POP>...
<FACE,42,1>I've already forgotten about losing! ...Just kidding!
<FACE,38,0>This is the first time that we were hit so often.
<FACE,34,2>I don't want to lose like this!
<FACE,33,0>Please teach me how to combine moves and items!
<FACE,38,0>I... I'm not angry! ...grrrr...
<FACE,57,2>Well, I did lose. But I, DUSTIN, gained some valuable experience.
<FACE,25,0>I haven't been taught that yet...
<FACE,10,0>This can't be possible... How could I lose with my level advantage?
<FACE,9,0>Waaaah! I don't like you at all! Yuck!
<FACE,24,1>My performance still needs some work. I'm going home to train by
juggling 100 times.

<FACE,20,2>You won't get anywhere if you can only tie me.
<FACE,58,1>That was a good match. Would you like to battle again?
<FACE,18,1>I guess these things happen.
<FACE,39,2>A draw, huh? You're pretty good.
<FACE,13,0>We're all friends!
<FACE,59,2>You're good, too!
<FACE,38,2>Well, this might be okay, too.
<FACE,41,1>Oh, wow. A friendly draw.
<FACE,0,1>What do you mean, it's a tie? I'm supposed to win!
<FACE,5,0>Ah, your efforts are inspiring.
<FACE,22,1>I couldn't beat the likes of you?
<FACE,36,0>Let's try that one more time.
<FACE,28,2>When it comes to sheer power, I'm better than you are!
<FACE,54,0>Something's wrong! This just isn't right...
<FACE,37,1>We should have no hard feelings over this.
<FACE,48,2>Stop! This match isn't over yet!
<FACE,47,0>What! You just got lucky, brat!
<FACE,45,1>What am I doing fighting against a brat like this?
<FACE,46,0>I must say, I had great confidence before the match.
<FACE,3,1>Hey! Let's have another go!
<FACE,55,2>That's enough battling. I'm off to the slopes.
<FACE,63,0>A draw, is it? I may have underestimated you.
<FACE,9,0>Arrrgh! So close! If only that had worked...
<FACE,10,2>Whew... We must be evenly matched.
<FACE,21,0>If you stall here, can you imagine what it would be like ahead?
<FACE,23,0>This battle will go down in history. I'm sure of it...
<FACE,32,2>Hmm... You don't appear to be a raw amateur after all.
<FACE,53,1>A draw!?! Who in the world are you?
<FACE,29,0>A draw...? But how...?
<FACE,61,2>That was an intense battle.
<FACE,35,2>A draw? No! Come on. Battle me again!
<FACE,40,2>This is peculiar...
<FACE,30,0>What? A draw? No way! That's not allowed!
<FACE,11,2>Isn't this remarkable?
<FACE,1,2>Whew. We can't end it this way.
<FACE,56,2>A draw? How is that possible?
<FACE,31,2>Hmm. You impress me.
<FACE,15,2>You just got lucky.
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,51,1>Hmph! How could I have only tied against the likes of you?
<FACE,39,2>A draw? Really?
<FACE,26,1>Neither of us were serious enough.
<FACE,62,0>Wah, ha, ha! That's the way it goes!
<FACE,50,2>What happens in this case? Referee?
<FACE,41,1>Is that right... A draw?
<FACE,27,0>Let me be!
<FACE,3,1>Let's settle the score, man!
<FACE,44,0>I'm worn out. I've had enough.
<FACE,7,0>I don't care about winning or losing.
<FACE,57,2>That's strange. A draw?
<FACE,19,0>We both were hot!
<FACE,4,2>Wa-hey! We'll do it again!
<FACE,52,0>That's too bad. You were so close, too.
<FACE,8,2>Listen, let's stop this now.
<FACE,5,0>At least I made a fair effort.
<FACE,34,1>So, was this a wasted battle?
<FACE,39,2>A draw? Really?
<FACE,26,1>Neither of us were serious enough.
<FACE,62,0>Wah, ha, ha! That's the way it goes!
<FACE,50,2>What happens in this case? Referee?
<FACE,41,1>Is that right... A draw?
<FACE,27,0>Let me be!
<FACE,3,1>Let's settle the score, man!
<FACE,44,0>I'm worn out. I've had enough.

<FACE,19,0>We both were hot!
<FACE,4,2>Wa-hey! We'll do it again!
<FACE,52,0>That's too bad. You were so close, too.
<FACE,8,2>Listen, let's stop this now.
<FACE,5,0>At least I made a fair effort.
<FACE,34,1>So, was this a wasted battle?
<FACE,6,1>That was a good battle. By the way, do you like camping?
<FACE,22,1>This cannot be helped.
<FACE,48,2>Boring...
<FACE,42,2>Hmm... I guess these things happen.
<FACE,16,2>I guess I got careless in the battle.
<FACE,12,2>Ohhh... You're not half bad.
<FACE,47,2>What's this all about?
<FACE,24,0>A draw is no good! Let's do it again!
<FACE,13,0>It's a tie. We're not happy about this.
<FACE,60,2>A tie, huh? Well, that's fine, too. I don't worry about the little
things.
<FACE,25,2>That's disappointing. What did I do wrong?
<FACE,2,2>This turned out strangely.
<FACE,43,0>Well, that was a good battle.
<FACE,33,1>Oh, a draw? I've never had one before.
<FACE,17,2>I didn't lose, that's what matters. But, then again, I didn't win...
<FACE,14,0>Hmm... These things sometimes happen.
<FACE,6,1>That was a good battle. By the way, do you like camping?
<FACE,22,1>This cannot be helped.
<FACE,48,2>Boring...
<FACE,42,2>Hmm... I guess these things happen.
<FACE,16,2>I guess I got careless in the battle.
<FACE,12,2>Ohhh... You're not half bad.
<FACE,47,2>What's this all about?
<FACE,24,0>A draw is no good! Let's do it again!
<FACE,13,0>It's a tie. We're not happy about this.
<FACE,60,2>A tie, huh? Well, that's fine, too. I don't worry about the little

<FACE,25,2>That's disappointing. What did I do wrong?
<FACE,2,2>This turned out strangely.
<FACE,43,0>Well, that was a good battle.
<FACE,33,1>Oh, a draw? I've never had one before.
<FACE,17,2>I didn't lose, that's what matters. But, then again, I didn't win...
<FACE,14,0>Hmm... These things sometimes happen.
<FACE,57,2>Ending like this is no good at all.
<FACE,42,2>These things happen.
<FACE,6,1>We can't let it end like this.
<FACE,7,0>A tie? That's fine, isn't it?
<FACE,25,2>And I was sure I had you beat...
<FACE,2,2>Oh. A nice, friendly tie.
<FACE,52,0>Hmm... Just a little bit more, I think.
<FACE,8,2>Well, uh... How about that? Not bad.
<FACE,38,2>Hmm... A draw. How interesting...
<FACE,28,2>Gimme more! Bring it on! I'm not quitting!
<FACE,58,2>Pretty decent, aren't you?
<FACE,9,2>How could this happen, I wonder?
<FACE,60,2>There are days when you go home empty-handed.
<FACE,17,2>I thought this might happen.
<FACE,55,2>Do you want to keep going?
<FACE,10,2>You wouldn't be satisfied with a tie?
<FACE,58,1>That was a good match. Would you like to battle again?
<FACE,18,1>I guess these things happen.
<FACE,39,2>A draw, huh? You're pretty good.
<FACE,13,0>We're all friends!
<FACE,59,2>You're good, too!
<FACE,38,2>Well, this might be okay, too.
<FACE,41,1>Oh, wow. A friendly draw.
<FACE,0,1>What do you mean, it's a tie? I'm supposed to win!
<FACE,5,0>Ah, your efforts are inspiring.
<FACE,22,1>I couldn't beat the likes of you?
<FACE,36,0>Let's try that one more time.
<FACE,28,2>When it comes to sheer power, I'm better than you are!
<FACE,54,0>Something's wrong! This just isn't right...
<FACE,37,1>We should have no hard feelings over this.
<FACE,48,2>Stop! This match isn't over yet!
<FACE,47,0>What! You just got lucky, brat!
<FACE,45,1>What am I doing fighting against a brat like this?
<FACE,46,0>I must say, I had great confidence before the match.
<FACE,3,1>Hey! Let's have another go!
<FACE,55,2>That's enough battling. I'm off to the slopes.
<FACE,63,0>A draw, is it? I may have underestimated you.
<FACE,9,0>Arrrgh! So close! If only that had worked...
<FACE,10,2>Whew... We must be evenly matched.
<FACE,21,0>If you stall here, can you imagine what it would be like ahead?
<FACE,23,0>This battle will go down in history. I'm sure of it...
<FACE,32,2>Hmm... You don't appear to be a raw amateur after all.
<FACE,53,1>A draw!?! Who in the world are you?
<FACE,29,0>A draw...? But how...?
<FACE,61,2>That was an intense battle.
<FACE,35,2>A draw? No! Come on. Battle me again!
<FACE,40,2>This is peculiar...
<FACE,30,0>What? A draw? No way! That's not allowed!
<FACE,11,2>Isn't this remarkable?

<FACE,19,0>We both were hot!
<FACE,4,2>Wa-hey! We'll do it again!
<FACE,52,0>That's too bad. You were so close, too.
<FACE,8,2>Listen, let's stop this now.

<FACE,6,1>That was a good battle. By the way, do you like camping?
<FACE,22,1>This cannot be helped.
<FACE,46,0>It resulted in a draw. What shall we do?
<FACE,42,2>Hmm... I guess these things happen.
<FACE,16,2>I guess I got careless in the battle.
<FACE,12,2>Ohhh... You're not half bad.
<FACE,45,1>Hey, what's this? What's this supposed to mean?
<FACE,24,0>A draw is no good! Let's do it again!

<FACE,20,2>What? You're giving up? Hmph...
<FACE,58,2>That's disappointing. I thought we could have a good battle.
<FACE,18,1>Ha, ha, ha! So, you're just going to turn tail and run?
<FACE,39,2>Why are you giving up? Let's finish this.
<FACE,13,0>What's the matter?
<FACE,59,2>Huh? Are you going to quit?
<FACE,38,2>Excuse me? What's the matter? That's so boring!
<FACE,41,1>What's wrong? You're going home already?
<FACE,0,1>You're giving up? No way. That's unbelievable.
<FACE,5,0>I believe that withdrawal is a form of etiquette.
<FACE,22,1>How pathetic of you.
<FACE,36,0>What are you intending to do?
<FACE,28,2>You're forfeiting? Hah! It's still a win for me!
<FACE,54,2>What? Well then, I may as well go home and take a nap...
<FACE,37,1>You're forfeiting? You must have important business to tend to.
<FACE,48,1>Wah, ha, ha...
<FACE,47,1>Look at the little coward running away!
<FACE,45,1>Buh-bye!
<FACE,46,0>Is that so? You're quitting?
<FACE,3,1>Come again, okay?
<FACE,55,2>What's that? Where are you going?
<FACE,63,0>There is no shame in withdrawing.
<FACE,9,2>Bye-bye!
<FACE,10,2>Okay. See you some other time.
<FACE,21,0>Good. That's an intelligent decision.
<FACE,23,0>You're quitting? After all you've done to get here?
<FACE,32,2>It would be better for you to try at another time.
<FACE,53,1>You must have realized the extent of our power.
<FACE,29,0>You're going to reappraise matters, aren't you?
<FACE,61,2>I never expected you to do that.
<FACE,35,2>Surrender? I don't know the meaning of the word!
<FACE,40,2>Are you saying you concede? I question that...
<FACE,30,1>Did the mighty MISTY scare you off?
<FACE,11,2>Oh? What on earth are you planning to do?
<FACE,1,2>Ha, ha, ha! Is that a ninja escape technique?
<FACE,56,2>It's not like you to run.
<FACE,31,2>Hee, hee... This still counts as a win for me.
<FACE,15,2>What? How boring is that?
<FACE,49,0>.........
<FACE,51,2>There you go. Go on home to your mommy.
<FACE,39,2>Hey, don't run away.
<FACE,26,1>You're going? Bye-bye.
<FACE,62,0>Okay then! I'll be seeing you!
<FACE,50,2>Whew, am I relieved.
<FACE,41,1>You're surrendering?
<FACE,27,0>Can I disappear now?
<FACE,3,1>Let's do this again, huh?
<FACE,44,0>I can't read your soul.
<FACE,7,0>You want to quit battling? Yes, yes. Let's stop!
<FACE,57,2>Huh, you're surrendering? That stinks!
<FACE,19,0>The fire's going out!
<FACE,4,2>Huh? You catch on quick.
<FACE,52,0>What's wrong? You shouldn't run away.
<FACE,8,2>You're quitting, huh? That's for the best. Definitely for the
best.
<FACE,5,0>Ah... A matter of some urgency has arisen?
<FACE,34,1>I concur. It's better this way.
<FACE,39,2>Hey, don't run away.
<FACE,26,1>You're going? Bye-bye.
<FACE,62,0>Okay then! I'll be seeing you!

<FACE,6,1>Oh, wait! Where are you going?
<FACE,22,1>A wise decision.
<FACE,48,2>What in the world are you doing?
<FACE,42,2>See you later.
<FACE,16,2>Hey, wait! Hear my performance out, will you?
<FACE,12,2>What's wrong? Feeling seasick?
<FACE,47,1>Ha, ha, ha... Run, little baby, run.
<FACE,24,1>Oh... I understand...
<FACE,13,0>Do you give up? It is still JAN and JANE's win.
<FACE,60,2>What? You're leaving? I guess the tide has changed...
<FACE,25,2>You're quitting? Why?
<FACE,2,2>I see. So this is the end?
<FACE,43,0>Be careful on your way home.
<FACE,33,1>What's wrong? You're leaving?
<FACE,17,2>Huh? You're running off?
<FACE,14,0>I see... It can't be helped.
<FACE,6,1>Oh, wait! Where are you going?
<FACE,22,1>A wise decision.

<FACE,57,2>I've never seen anyone surrender before.
<FACE,42,2>Oh, well. Whatever.
<FACE,6,1>Well, if that's what you want...
<FACE,7,0>You're protective of your POKÈMON, too, aren't you?
<FACE,25,2>Well, I know how you feel.
<FACE,2,2>My, aren't you strange?
<FACE,52,0>What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?
<FACE,8,2>Try again some other time.
<FACE,38,2>Ha, ha, ha... Chickened out! Bok, bok, bok!
<FACE,28,2>Aye! I'll accept your challenge anytime!
<FACE,58,2>Oh! So you're gonna run...
<FACE,9,2>Oh? But why?
<FACE,60,2>You're bailing already?
<FACE,17,2>Okay, good-bye.
<FACE,55,2>You're quitting?
<FACE,10,2>You came all this way just to quit?
<FACE,58,2>That's disappointing. I thought we could have a good battle.
<FACE,18,1>Ha, ha, ha! So, you're just going to turn tail and run?

<FACE,46,0>Ah... Very good. A wise philosophy.
<FACE,42,2>See you later.
<FACE,16,2>Hey, wait! Hear my performance out, will you?
<FACE,12,2>What's wrong? Feeling seasick?
<FACE,45,1>That's right... That's the right move.
<FACE,24,1>Oh... I understand...
<FACE,13,0>Do you give up? It is still JAN and JANE's win.
<FACE,60,2>What? You're leaving? I guess the tide has changed...
<FACE,25,2>You're quitting? Why?
<FACE,2,2>I see. So this is the end?
<FACE,43,0>Be careful on your way home.
<FACE,33,1>What's wrong? You're leaving?
<FACE,17,2>Huh? You're running off?
<FACE,14,0>I see... It can't be helped.
<FACE,6,1>Oh, wait! Where are you going?
<FACE,22,1>A wise decision.

<FACE,57,2>I've never seen anyone surrender before.
<FACE,42,2>Oh, well. Whatever.
<FACE,6,1>Well, if that's what you want...
<FACE,7,0>You're protective of your POKÈMON, too, aren't you?
<FACE,25,2>Well, I know how you feel.
<FACE,2,2>My, aren't you strange?
<FACE,52,0>What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?
<FACE,8,2>Try again some other time.
<FACE,38,2>Ha, ha, ha... Chickened out! Bok, bok, bok!
<FACE,28,2>Aye! I'll accept your challenge anytime!
<FACE,58,2>Oh! So you're gonna run...
<FACE,9,2>Oh? But why?
<FACE,60,2>You're bailing already?
<FACE,17,2>Okay, good-bye.
<FACE,55,2>You're quitting?
<FACE,10,2>You came all this way just to quit?
<FACE,51,2>There you go. Go on home to your mommy.
<FACE,6,1>You should go to the LIBRARY to study the advantages of
different POKÈMON-type match ups.
<FACE,50,1>The path of logic is unforgiving.
<FACE,25,2>Make sure you study before you come back. Let's go to the
LIBRARY.
<FACE,26,1>Let's go to an indoor pool where it's warm.
<FACE,57,0>Huh? You're surrendering already? That was simple!
<FACE,42,2>It must be about time for me to go on my picnic.
<FACE,38,2>Excuse me? What's the matter? That's so boring!
<FACE,34,0>You should take some of Earl's lectures.
<FACE,33,1>What's wrong? You're leaving?
<FACE,38,2>Let's battle again. I'll keep my schedule open.
<FACE,57,1>You're giving up already? Too easy!
<FACE,25,1>You're going to do your homework? You're surprisingly
responsible.
<FACE,10,1>Oh, you're quitting? Lucky for me!
<FACE,9,2>...Will you battle with me again?
<FACE,24,0>Join me on the road sometime.
<FACE,2,2>You're too obvious!
